## 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SentryInsight.git
   cd SentryInsight
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file with your OpenAI API key
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
   ```

4. Configure the tool:
   ```bash
   # Review and edit config.json to set your preferences
   # - RSS feed sources
   # - Output paths
   # - Analysis parameters
   ```

## 📊 Usage

Run the main workflow:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch the latest security articles from configured RSS feeds
2. Enrich articles with full content
3. Filter for exploitation-relevant information
4. Generate a comprehensive exploitation report
5. Save the report to the configured output location

## 🔄 Workflow Stages

1. **Feed Fetching**: RSS feeds are retrieved using MCP tools
2. **Content Enrichment**: Articles are expanded with full content
3. **Exploitation Filtering**: Articles are filtered for security relevance
4. **Intelligence Analysis**: OpenAI analyzes content for exploitation details
5. **Report Generation**: Findings are compiled into a structured report
6. **Publication**: Reports are saved as Markdown files
