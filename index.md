# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. The most significant threats include Russia's APT28 group deploying the 'NotDoor' malware to target Microsoft Outlook for covert data exfiltration, and the emergence of HexStrike-AI, a new AI-powered offensive security framework being used by hackers to rapidly exploit newly disclosed n-day vulnerabilities. Additionally, Google has addressed two actively exploited Android vulnerabilities in their September 2025 security update, highlighting ongoing mobile security concerns. The persistence of compromised routers on the internet for extended periods and various data breaches affecting major organizations further underscore the current threat landscape.
