# Exploitation Report

During the past week, threat actors have moved quickly to weaponize freshly disclosed flaws and novel attack techniques across consumer, enterprise, and critical-infrastructure technologies. The most serious activity centers on active remote-code-execution (RCE) attacks against Wing FTP Server and Fortinet FortiWeb appliances, high-impact prompt-injection bugs in Google’s Gemini AI services, and wide-scale abuse of leaked secrets in Laravel applications and public Git repositories. At the same time, the Interlock ransomware group debuted a new FileFix web-inject vector, researchers warned of Secure Boot bypasses on Gigabyte motherboards, and a one-click Bluetooth attack chain dubbed “PerfektBlue” was shown to threaten hundreds of millions of vehicles and IoT devices. Collectively, these developments underscore an aggressive exploitation landscape in which proof-of-concept code is weaponized within hours and supply-chain weaknesses remain a favorite avenue for initial access.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Wing FTP Server Critical RCE
- **Description**: A flaw in Wing FTP Server allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending crafted requests after directory traversal and command-injection manipulation.  
- **Impact**: Full system compromise, lateral movement inside enterprise networks, and potential data exfiltration.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild within 24 hours of public disclosure; vendor patches available in the latest release.

### Fortinet FortiWeb Pre-Auth SQLi to RCE
- **Description**: A critical SQL-injection vulnerability in FortiWeb Web Application Firewalls enables pre-authentication execution of system commands through crafted HTTP requests.  
- **Impact**: Remote takeover of WAF appliances, network pivoting, and interception of protected web traffic.  
- **Status**: Public proof-of-concept exploits released; in-the-wild scanning observed; Fortinet has issued firmware updates.

### Google Gemini Prompt-Injection Flaws
- **Description**: Logic flaws in Gemini’s context parsing let attackers embed invisible or obfuscated prompts that appear to end-users as legitimate security alerts or email summaries.  
- **Impact**: Covert phishing, credential harvesting, and execution of malicious workflows inside Google Workspace.  
- **Status**: Zero-day abuse techniques demonstrated; Google is investigating and has not yet released definitive mitigations.

### Interlock “FileFix/ClickFix” Web-Inject Chain
- **Description**: Interlock ransomware operators inject malicious JavaScript into legitimate sites using the FileFix loader to drop a new PHP-based Interlock RAT.  
- **Impact**: Remote access, payload delivery of ransomware, and data theft across multiple industries.  
- **Status**: Large-scale campaign confirmed; no vendor patch (attack vector leverages trusted sites rather than a software bug).

### Gigabyte UEFI Secure Boot Bypass
- **Description**: Multiple Gigabyte motherboard UEFI firmware images allow unsigned code execution during boot, enabling stealth bootkits that survive OS reinstalls and evade AV.  
- **Impact**: Persistent root-level malware, complete host control, and long-term espionage capabilities.  
- **Status**: Exploitable condition reported; Gigabyte is releasing BIOS updates per model.

### “PerfektBlue” One-Click Bluetooth RCE
- **Description**: A chained vulnerability set in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chipsets can be triggered from pairing distance, leading to code execution on vehicles, industrial controllers, and consumer devices.  
- **Impact**: Remote unlocking or hijacking of cars, disruption of industrial systems, and compromise of mobile/medical devices.  
- **Status**: Exploit demonstrated; patches pending from multiple vendors, risk remains high.

### GPUHammer (RowHammer Variant on NVIDIA GPUs)
- **Description**: A memory-disturbance attack flips bits in GDDR6 VRAM, corrupting AI model weights and enabling potential privilege escalation on systems lacking ECC.  
- **Impact**: Data integrity loss, model poisoning, and possible code execution via corrupted pointers.  
- **Status**: Proof-of-concept only; NVIDIA advises enabling system-level ECC.

### Kigen eUICC eSIM Weakness
- **Description**: Design flaws in Kigen-based embedded SIMs permit unauthorized profile manipulation and cloning through over-the-air updates.  
- **Impact**: Device impersonation, interception of cellular data, and fraud across billions of IoT endpoints.  
- **Status**: No firmware fix yet; mitigations require carrier-side validation controls.

### Laravel APP_KEY Leakage RCE
- **Description**: Exposure of Laravel’s APP_KEY in public repos allows attackers to craft encrypted session cookies that execute arbitrary PHP code on vulnerable apps.  
- **Impact**: Complete compromise of more than 600 identified web applications.  
- **Status**: Actively abused; remediation requires key rotation and secret management.

### Exposed Git Repository Secrets
- **Description**: Misconfigured public Git repositories reveal API keys, credentials, and infrastructure files, enabling direct exploitation and shadow-IT expansion.  
- **Impact**: Lateral movement, privilege escalation, service disruption, and data breaches.  
- **Status**: Ongoing mass-scanning and automated harvesting by multiple threat actors.

### WordPress Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: Attackers compromised the developer’s website and replaced manual plugin installers with backdoored versions containing remote shell functionality.  
- **Impact**: Arbitrary code execution on WordPress sites installing the tainted package.  
- **Status**: Malicious files have been taken down; users must verify hashes and reinstall clean versions.

### Malicious VSCode Extension in Cursor IDE
- **Description**: A trojanized Visual Studio Code extension delivered through the Cursor AI IDE drops RATs and infostealers, leading to cryptocurrency theft.  
- **Impact**: Credential harvesting, wallet drainage (USD 500 k confirmed), and developer workstation takeover.  
- **Status**: Extension removed; victims must audit extensions and rotate secrets.

### Leaked xAI API Key Incident
- **Description**: An internal DOGE employee exposed an xAI API key that granted access to sensitive U.S. government databases.  
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data harvesting and potential identity theft.  
- **Status**: Key revoked; investigation ongoing.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution**: Crafted network requests exploit Wing FTP and FortiWeb flaws to gain system-level access.  
- **Prompt Injection**: Invisible Unicode/formatting abuses mislead Google Gemini into executing attacker-defined instructions.  
- **FileFix Web-Inject**: Malicious JavaScript sideloaded through legitimate sites delivers Interlock RAT payloads.  
- **UEFI Bootkit Installation**: Unsigned firmware components executed during boot on Gigabyte boards, bypassing Secure Boot.  
- **One-Click Bluetooth RCE (“PerfektBlue”)**: LMP packet manipulation triggers memory corruption leading to code execution.
