# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing significant exploitation activity across multiple vectors, with zero-day vulnerabilities in critical systems being actively targeted by threat actors. Most notably, hackers are exploiting zero-day flaws in Microsoft's Chakra JavaScript engine within Internet Explorer mode, prompting Microsoft to implement access restrictions. Oracle's E-Business Suite faces active exploitation through a recently disclosed zero-day vulnerability that allows unauthorized remote access without authentication. Additionally, the RondoDox botnet has emerged as a major threat, weaponizing over 50 vulnerabilities across 30+ vendors in a shotgun-style exploitation approach. Widespread credential-based attacks are also occurring, with over 100 SonicWall SSL VPN accounts compromised using stolen valid credentials, while massive botnets target RDP services across the United States.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft Chakra JavaScript Engine Zero-Day
- **Description**: Zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Chakra JavaScript engine within Internet Explorer mode of Edge browser
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain access to target devices by leveraging these flaws as a backdoor mechanism
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; Microsoft has implemented access restrictions to IE mode as mitigation

### Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security flaw in Oracle E-Business Suite that allows unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Impact**: Remote attackers can access sensitive data without authentication, leading to potential data breaches
- **Status**: Actively exploited; Oracle has issued an emergency security patch over the weekend

### RondoDox Botnet Multi-Vendor Exploitation
- **Description**: Malware campaign exploiting over 50 vulnerabilities across more than 30 vendors in consumer edge devices
- **Impact**: Botnet operators can compromise various network devices and systems using a "shotgun" approach to exploitation
- **Status**: Ongoing active exploitation targeting edge devices worldwide

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Edge Browser**: Internet Explorer mode functionality specifically targeted through Chakra engine vulnerabilities
- **Oracle E-Business Suite**: All versions vulnerable to the newly disclosed zero-day flaw
- **SonicWall SSL VPN Devices**: Over 100 accounts compromised through credential-based attacks
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Services**: Targeted by large-scale botnet from over 100,000 IP addresses
- **Consumer Edge Devices**: Various network devices from 30+ vendors targeted by RondoDox botnet
- **Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices**: Compromised devices on major U.S. ISPs including AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon used in DDoS attacks

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Zero-Day Exploitation**: Direct exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in Chakra JavaScript engine and Oracle E-Business Suite
- **Credential Stuffing**: Use of stolen valid credentials to compromise SonicWall VPN accounts
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Large-scale botnet targeting RDP services across the United States
- **Shotgun Exploitation**: RondoDox botnet's approach of exploiting multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously across diverse vendor products
- **Tool Abuse**: Legitimate DFIR tool Velociraptor being weaponized by threat actors for ransomware attacks
- **Infrastructure Abuse**: GitHub repositories used by Astaroth banking trojan for operational resilience

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unknown Threat Actors**: Actively exploiting Microsoft Chakra engine zero-days, prompting emergency mitigation measures
- **Clop Ransomware Gang**: Exploiting Oracle zero-day vulnerability, with Harvard University listed as a victim on their leak site
- **Storm-2603 (CL-CRI-1040)**: Chinese threat group abusing Velociraptor DFIR tool in LockBit ransomware operations
- **RondoDox Operators**: Conducting widespread exploitation campaigns targeting consumer edge devices globally
- **Astaroth Banking Trojan Operators**: Using GitHub as operational backbone to maintain persistence after infrastructure takedowns
- **Multi-Country Botnet Operators**: Coordinating attacks against U.S. RDP services from over 100,000 IP addresses
- **GXC Team Cybercrime Syndicate**: Recently dismantled by Spanish authorities, with leader "GoogleXcoder" arrested
- **ShinyHunters Group**: Extortion operations disrupted by federal authorities, though threats against Salesforce victims remain active
