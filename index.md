# Exploitation Report

Recent reporting highlights active exploitation of critical vulnerabilities affecting networking and enterprise solutions, alongside large-scale exposure of misconfigured devices. Attackers are focusing on bypassing authentication controls in Cisco and HPE products, exploiting three security flaws patched by Qualcomm, and targeting widely deployed technologies such as solar monitoring devices and Asus routers. Threat actors employ a range of tactics, from malicious package impersonation to sophisticated social engineering, to infiltrate corporate environments and steal sensitive data.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Auth Bypass
- **Description**: A critical flaw in Cisco ISE that allows unauthenticated threat actors to bypass login controls, potentially leading to full administrative access.
- **Impact**: Attackers can perform malicious actions, such as network segmentation manipulation and unauthorized policy changes.
- **Status**: Security patches have been released, and organizations using Cisco ISE are urged to apply them immediately.

### Cisco ISE and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) Flaws
- **Description**: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco ISE and CCP with publicly available exploit code, making exploitation easier for attackers.
- **Impact**: May enable adversaries to gain elevated privileges, intercept network traffic, or exfiltrate sensitive information.
- **Status**: Patches are available from Cisco, and these should be deployed without delay.

### Qualcomm Exploited Security Flaws
- **Description**: Three security flaws in Qualcomm chipsets that attackers have exploited to gain unauthorized access or trigger malicious code execution.
- **Impact**: Potential device compromise and data exposure on mobile devices reliant on Qualcomm components.
- **Status**: Qualcomm has issued fixes, but end-user devices remain vulnerable until manufacturers release corresponding firmware updates.

### HPE StoreOnce Authentication Bypass
- **Description**: A set of vulnerabilities in HPE StoreOnce data backup products that can allow remote attackers to bypass authentication.
- **Impact**: May lead to unauthorized access to backup infrastructure, data manipulation, or complete data theft.
- **Status**: HPE has provided security updates; customers must ensure they apply these fixes promptly.

### 35K Solar Devices Exposure
- **Description**: Tens of thousands of solar monitoring devices are exposed on the Internet with default or weak configurations, enabling hijacking.
- **Impact**: Attackers could take control of monitoring panels, disrupt solar power operations, or pivot into wider networks.
- **Status**: Recommended mitigations include stronger access controls and proper network segmentation.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)**: Particularly cloud deployments on AWS, Azure, and OCI  
- **Cisco Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP)**: On-premises and cloud-based call center solutions  
- **Qualcomm-based Devices**: Smartphones, IoT devices, and other products reliant on Qualcomm chipsets  
- **HPE StoreOnce Data Backup**: All vulnerable versions of the StoreOnce product line  
- **Solar Monitoring Devices**: Various models exposed to the Internet with weak or default settings  
- **Asus Routers**: Devices vulnerable to botnet enrollment due to misconfiguration or outdated firmware  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Authentication Bypass**: Exploiting flawed or unpatched authentication mechanisms in enterprise products  
- **Public Exploit Code**: Readily available proof-of-concept scripts accelerating attacks against unpatched systems  
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious packages in open-source repositories (npm, PyPI, RubyGems) targeting unsuspecting developers  
- **Botnet Infiltration**: Compromising routers and IoT devices to form distributed botnet networks  
- **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Social engineering tactics used to trick organizations into relinquishing credentials or installing malicious software  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **State Hackers tied to RedLine**: Infostealer distribution and government-sponsored operations  
- **UNC6040 / Vishing Crew**: Impersonating Salesforce applications to steal data and conduct extortion  
- **Play Ransomware**: Breaching hundreds of organizations, including those in critical sectors  
- **Crypto-Mining Hacker**: Compromising hosting accounts to mine cryptocurrency at victimsâ€™ expense  
- **BidenCash Carding Market**: Facilitating large-scale sale of stolen credit card data via seized domains  
- **Malicious Open-Source Package Operators**: Infiltrating software repositories to capture sensitive data or destroy codebases  
- **Chaos RAT Operators**: Leveraging fake network tools to infect Windows and Linux systems with remote access trojans
