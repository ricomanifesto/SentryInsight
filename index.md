# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security vulnerabilities being actively exploited across multiple platforms and technologies. Most notably, password managers are facing unpatched clickjacking vulnerabilities that could expose user credentials and sensitive data to attackers. Additionally, AI-powered browsers are susceptible to a new prompt injection technique called PromptFix that allows malicious actors to execute hidden commands. The cybercriminal ecosystem continues to evolve with sophisticated botnet operations like RapperBot conducting massive DDoS campaigns, while North Korean threat actors are leveraging legitimate platforms like GitHub for cyber espionage operations targeting diplomatic missions.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Password Manager Clickjacking Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Six major password managers with tens of millions of users contain unpatched clickjacking flaws that can be exploited to steal sensitive user data
- **Impact**: Attackers can steal account credentials, two-factor authentication codes, and credit card information from affected password manager users
- **Status**: Currently unpatched and actively exploitable across multiple major password management platforms

### PromptFix AI Browser Exploit
- **Description**: A new prompt injection technique that tricks generative AI models into executing malicious hidden prompts by embedding them within legitimate content
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to manipulate AI browsers into carrying out unintended actions and potentially compromise user interactions with AI systems
- **Status**: Actively demonstrated by cybersecurity researchers as a viable attack vector against AI-powered browsing platforms

### RapperBot DDoS Botnet Operations
- **Description**: A sophisticated distributed denial-of-service botnet operation that has conducted extensive attack campaigns
- **Impact**: Responsible for launching over 370,000 DDoS attacks against various targets, causing significant service disruptions
- **Status**: Law enforcement action taken with charges filed against the alleged operator

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Password Managers**: Six major password management platforms with tens of millions of combined users affected by clickjacking vulnerabilities
- **AI Browsers**: Generative AI-powered browsing platforms susceptible to PromptFix prompt injection attacks
- **IoT Devices**: Various internet-connected devices compromised and incorporated into the RapperBot botnet infrastructure
