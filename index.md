# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are currently being exploited across multiple enterprise platforms, with threat actors targeting Oracle E-Business Suite, Zimbra Collaboration Suite, and Fortra GoAnywhere systems. The most severe activity involves CVE-2025-61882 in Oracle EBS being actively exploited by the Cl0p ransomware group for data theft attacks, while CVE-2025-27915 in Zimbra was exploited as a zero-day earlier this year targeting Brazilian military infrastructure. Additionally, Storm-1175 has been leveraging a critical GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability for Medusa ransomware deployment, and a maximum severity Redis flaw presents remote code execution risks to thousands of instances. These attacks demonstrate sophisticated techniques including malicious ICS file exploitation and AI-based data exfiltration methods.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day
- **Description**: Critical security flaw allowing unauthenticated remote code execution in Oracle's enterprise business software
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to enterprise systems and steal sensitive data without authentication
- **Status**: Oracle has released emergency patches after active exploitation was detected
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-61882

### Zimbra Collaboration Suite Zero-Day
- **Description**: Security vulnerability in Zimbra email and collaboration platform exploited through malicious ICS calendar files
- **Impact**: Enables attackers to compromise email systems and target military infrastructure
- **Status**: Now patched, but was exploited as zero-day earlier in 2025
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-27915

### GoAnywhere MFT Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: Maximum severity security flaw in Fortra's managed file transfer software
- **Impact**: Allows threat actors to deploy ransomware and compromise file transfer systems
- **Status**: Actively exploited for nearly a month in ransomware campaigns

### Redis Maximum Severity Flaw
- **Description**: 13-year-old vulnerability in Redis in-memory database software with CVSS 10.0 rating
- **Impact**: Remote code execution under certain circumstances affecting thousands of instances
- **Status**: Patches released, but vulnerability has existed for over a decade

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Oracle E-Business Suite**: Enterprise business applications affected by critical remote code execution vulnerability
- **Zimbra Collaboration Suite**: Email and collaboration platforms vulnerable to malicious calendar file attacks
