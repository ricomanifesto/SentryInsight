# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting diverse platforms and systems. Chinese state-sponsored threat actors are actively exploiting cloud trust relationships to compromise downstream customers, while multiple campaigns leverage known vulnerabilities in GeoServer and expose Redis servers to malicious activities. Additionally, threat actors are deploying sophisticated attack techniques including Linux-specific malware delivery chains, new macOS infostealers, and novel attack vectors targeting both enterprise and consumer systems. Apple has recently patched a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) that was actively exploited in sophisticated attacks against targeted individuals, potentially indicating nation-state or spyware operations.
