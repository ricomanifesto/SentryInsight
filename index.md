# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing a significant wave of critical exploitation activity, with Cisco network infrastructure bearing the brunt of multiple zero-day attacks. Nation-state actors and cybercriminal groups are actively exploiting vulnerabilities across enterprise systems, from network appliances to development environments. Most concerning are the actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA firewalls and IOS software that have prompted emergency directives from CISA, alongside sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting developer ecosystems through malicious packages and AI-powered social engineering campaigns.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software VPN web servers
- **Impact**: Attackers can exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to firewall systems and potentially compromise network security
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; CISA has issued an emergency directive requiring federal agencies to patch immediately

### Cisco IOS SNMP Vulnerability
- **Description**: High-severity security flaw in Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software affecting SNMP functionality
- **Impact**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or trigger denial-of-service conditions on affected systems
- **Status**: Actively exploited; patches available and deployment urged

### GeoServer Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: Critical vulnerability in GeoServer geospatial software used by federal agencies
- **Impact**: Threat actors successfully breached a large federal civilian executive branch agency through this vulnerability
- **Status**: Exploited within two weeks of disclosure; federal agency compromised
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-36401

### Salesforce Agentforce ForcedLeak Bug
- **Description**: Critical flaw in Salesforce Agentforce AI agent platform allowing indirect prompt injection attacks
- **Impact**: Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive CRM data and customer information through AI prompt manipulation
- **Status**: Recently patched by Salesforce after security researcher disclosure

### Supermicro BMC Firmware Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Two vulnerabilities affecting Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware in Supermicro hardware
- **Impact**: Attackers can create persistent backdoors by updating systems with maliciously crafted firmware images
- **Status**: Newly disclosed; patches required for affected hardware
