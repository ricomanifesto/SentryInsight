# Comprehensive Exploitation Report

## 1. Summary of the Most Critical Exploitation Activity

Recent security reports highlight a surge in actively exploited vulnerabilities affecting a wide array of products and services. Zero-day flaws in Google Chrome (CVE-2025-5419), actively exploited router bugs (CVE-2023-39780), and newly patched but already abused vulnerabilities (e.g., Qualcomm chips, HPE StoreOnce, Cisco ISE and CCP) demonstrate broad threat actor interest across enterprise, consumer, and infrastructure targets. Of particular note:

- A Chrome zero-day (CVE-2025-5419) is confirmed to be exploited in the wild.  
- Attackers leverage multiple flaws (CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, CVE-2024-57728) to aid the Play ransomware attacks.  
- Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20286, CVE-2025-20130, CVE-2025-20129) now have public exploit code.  
- Critical vulnerabilities in Asus routers (CVE-2023-39780) are being used to conscript devices into botnets.  
- HPE StoreOnce and Qualcomm vulnerabilities have active exploits and require urgent patching.  
- A 10-year-old Roundcube webmail flaw (CVE-2025-49113) has been abused, demonstrating that even long-standing bugs can pose major threats if left unpatched.  

Threat actors range from ransomware gangs to financially motivated cybercriminals, using sophisticated phishing (vishing) and multi-stage PowerShell attacks targeting Windows, Linux, and networking hardware.
