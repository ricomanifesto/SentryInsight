# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited by sophisticated threat actors across multiple enterprise systems. The Clop ransomware gang has been exploiting a critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) since early August for data theft operations, while the Storm-1175 threat group is leveraging a maximum severity Fortra GoAnywhere flaw (CVE-2025-10035) to deploy Medusa ransomware. Additionally, a 13-year-old Redis vulnerability with a perfect CVSS 10.0 score presents immediate remote code execution risks to over 300,000 exposed instances. These exploitation campaigns demonstrate the persistent threat landscape targeting enterprise infrastructure and managed file transfer solutions.
