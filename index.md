# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting multiple high-value systems across cloud infrastructure, enterprise security solutions, and government networks. State-sponsored threat actors are actively exploiting vulnerabilities in Libraesva Email Security Gateway solutions and GeoServer instances to breach federal agencies. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are leveraging CVE-2025-51591 in Pandoc to target AWS cloud environments and steal EC2 IAM credentials. The ShadowV2 botnet is exploiting misconfigured Docker containers for DDoS-for-hire services, while Scattered Spider continues large-scale ransomware operations generating over $115 million in proceeds. Additional threats include SEO poisoning campaigns using BadIIS malware, supply chain attacks through npm packages, and newly discovered vulnerabilities in Supermicro BMC firmware that could bypass root of trust security mechanisms.
