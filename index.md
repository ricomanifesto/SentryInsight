# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals significant nation-state activity targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. F5 BIG-IP environments have been compromised through zero-day vulnerabilities, resulting in the theft of source code and undisclosed security flaws. Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addressed 183 security vulnerabilities, including three zero-days actively exploited in the wild. Meanwhile, Chinese threat actors continue sophisticated campaigns, with groups like Flax Typhoon and Jewelbug conducting long-term infiltrations of Russian IT networks and compromising ArcGIS servers for persistent backdoor access. Critical industrial control systems face maximum-severity vulnerabilities, while Oracle zero-day attacks have impacted major institutions including Harvard University.
