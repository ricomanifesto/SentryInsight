# Exploitation Report

Based on the provided security articles, there is limited active exploitation activity reported. The most significant security concern involves a FortiWeb web application firewall vulnerability that allows complete authentication bypass, with a security researcher preparing to release a proof-of-concept exploit. Additionally, Workday disclosed a data breach resulting from a social engineering attack targeting their third-party CRM platform, and the ERMAC 3.0 Android banking trojan source code has been leaked, exposing the malware's complete infrastructure.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewall that allows remote attackers to completely bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected web applications and potentially compromise entire network security perimeters
- **Status**: Researcher has released partial proof-of-concept exploit and plans to release full exploit code

### Workday Data Breach via Social Engineering
- **Description**: Social engineering attack targeting Workday's third-party customer relationship management (CRM) platform
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to customer data and potential exposure of sensitive HR information
- **Status**: Breach disclosed by Workday, investigation ongoing

## Affected Systems and Products

- **FortiWeb Web Application Firewall**: All versions affected by the authentication bypass vulnerability
- **Workday CRM Platform**: Third-party customer relationship management system compromised through social engineering
- **Android Devices**: Targeted by ERMAC 3.0 banking trojan with leaked source code potentially enabling widespread deployment

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Authentication Bypass**: Remote exploitation of FortiWeb firewall allowing complete security control circumvention
- **Social Engineering**: Targeted attacks against third-party service providers to gain access to customer data
- **Banking Trojan Distribution**: ERMAC 3.0 source code leak enables threat actors to deploy customized Android malware campaigns

## Threat Actor Activities

- **ERMAC Banking Trojan Operators**: Infrastructure exposed through source code leak revealing operational security weaknesses and complete malware architecture
