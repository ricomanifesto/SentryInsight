# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting enterprise infrastructure and supply chain components. State-sponsored actors are actively deploying XenoRAT malware against diplomatic targets in South Korea, while the Noodlophile stealer campaign has expanded globally using sophisticated copyright-themed phishing lures. Critical vulnerabilities in N-able N-central servers remain unpatched despite active exploitation warnings, and threat actors continue to leverage Salesforce systems for large-scale data breaches affecting major organizations including Allianz Life and Workday. Additionally, the ERMAC Android banking trojan source code leak has exposed malware-as-a-service infrastructure, potentially enabling broader exploitation campaigns.
