# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day and active exploitation activities are currently targeting enterprise infrastructure across multiple sectors. Chinese threat actors have been exploiting a VMware zero-day vulnerability since October 2024, affecting VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools software. Additionally, nearly 50,000 Cisco firewalls remain vulnerable to actively exploited flaws, while a critical Linux sudo vulnerability (CVE-2025-32463) is being leveraged by attackers to gain root-level privileges. Banking trojans, phishing campaigns, and sophisticated malware toolkits are also being deployed against users worldwide, with particular focus on European and Asian targets.

## Active Exploitation Details
