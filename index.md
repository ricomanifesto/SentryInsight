# Exploitation Report

Critical security incidents are currently impacting major technology platforms and enterprise infrastructure. Google has patched a sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability this year that is being actively exploited in attacks, specifically targeting the V8 JavaScript engine. Meanwhile, WatchGuard has disclosed a critical remote code execution vulnerability in their Firebox firewall products. The threat landscape shows sophisticated attack campaigns including the ShinyHunters group claiming massive data theft from Salesforce through compromised OAuth tokens, and the TA558 threat actor deploying AI-generated scripts to distribute Venom RAT malware. Additionally, several major organizations including SonicWall and Insight Partners have disclosed significant security breaches affecting customer data and credentials.
