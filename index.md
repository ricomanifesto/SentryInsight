# Exploitation Report

Current security intelligence reveals a concerning landscape of active exploitation targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Multiple nation-state actors are leveraging both zero-day vulnerabilities and recently disclosed flaws to compromise cloud environments, networking equipment, and mobile platforms. Notable activities include Chinese threat groups exploiting VMware vulnerabilities for nearly a year, active exploitation of Cisco firewall flaws affecting 50,000+ devices, and sophisticated attacks targeting Intel SGX security features through novel hardware-based techniques. Banking trojans are evolving with advanced remote control capabilities, while new attack frameworks are weaponizing PDF documents for credential theft campaigns.

## Active Exploitation Details
