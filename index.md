# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals a surge in critical zero-day exploitation and advanced persistent threats targeting government agencies, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise systems. Federal agencies have fallen victim to sophisticated attacks exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities in geospatial systems, while zero-day vulnerabilities in network infrastructure continue to be actively exploited. Chinese state-sponsored groups have intensified their targeting of U.S. organizations using advanced backdoor malware for long-term persistence operations. Additionally, ransomware groups are exploiting enterprise management systems, and supply chain attacks through package repositories are becoming increasingly sophisticated with novel obfuscation techniques.
