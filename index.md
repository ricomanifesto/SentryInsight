# Exploitation Report

# Executive Summary
The cybersecurity landscape is currently facing significant threats from multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack vectors. Notably, Microsoft and SAP have patched several zero-day vulnerabilities that were actively exploited, including a critical remote code execution flaw in Fortinet's FortiVoice systems. Additionally, Chinese threat actors have been identified targeting Taiwanese drone manufacturers and exploiting SAP vulnerabilities to breach critical systems globally. New attack techniques, such as the "Branch Privilege Injection" flaw in Intel CPUs, pose a high risk of data leakage from privileged memory. Security teams must prioritize patching these vulnerabilities and monitoring for related threat actor activities.

## Active Exploitation Details

Several zero-day vulnerabilities have been actively exploited:
- Microsoft patched five zero-day vulnerabilities, including a critical browser-led remote code execution (RCE) flaw.
- SAP addressed a zero-day vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver servers, exploited by China-linked APTs.
- Fortinet fixed a critical zero-day RCE vulnerability in FortiVoice systems.
- Ivanti patched zero-days in their Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) software, used in chained attacks for RCE.
- A new Intel CPU flaw, "Branch Privilege Injection," allows data leakage from privileged memory.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft**: Windows operating systems affected by multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
- **SAP**: NetWeaver servers targeted by zero-day exploits.
- **Fortinet**: FortiVoice enterprise phone systems vulnerable to RCE attacks.
- **Ivanti**: Endpoint Manager Mobile and Neurons for ITSM affected by critical vulnerabilities.
- **Intel**: All modern CPUs impacted by the "Branch Privilege Injection" flaw.
- **TeleMessage**: Vulnerability allowing unauthorized access to archived data.
- **PyPI**: Malicious package posing as a Solana tool, affecting developers who downloaded it.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Remote Code Execution**: Exploited via browser-led attacks on Windows and SAP NetWeaver servers.
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Chinese actors targeting ERP software and service providers in the drone and satellite sectors.
- **Memory Data Leakage**: Intel CPU flaw allows attackers to extract sensitive data from privileged memory.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Ivanti's Neurons for ITSM flaw allows unauthorized access.
- **Malicious Packages**: PyPI repository used to distribute malware disguised as legitimate tools.

## Threat Actor Activities

s
- **Chinese APTs**: Actively exploiting SAP vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-31324) to target critical infrastructure and supply chains.
- **Tidrone**: Focused on military and satellite sectors, leveraging ERP software for widespread infection.
- **Unknown Actors**: Exploiting Intel CPU flaws and distributing malicious PyPI packages to steal source code.

Security teams should prioritize patching the identified vulnerabilities, especially those actively exploited, and enhance monitoring for indicators of compromise associated with these threat actors.
