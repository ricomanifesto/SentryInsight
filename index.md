# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting diverse platforms and infrastructure. Threat actors are actively exploiting Android devices through sophisticated spyware campaigns impersonating legitimate messaging applications, while simultaneously conducting large-scale extortion operations against enterprise Oracle systems and ransomware attacks on critical business infrastructure. Notable hardware-level attacks against Intel SGX processors demonstrate evolving attack sophistication, with researchers proving that cryptographic keys can be extracted through novel side-channel techniques. Meanwhile, multiple high-profile data breaches have compromised millions of customer records across various sectors, from airlines to insurance companies, highlighting the ongoing vulnerability of enterprise systems to both targeted attacks and opportunistic exploitation.
