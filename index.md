# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently focused on several high-impact vulnerabilities across major platforms. Google has patched its sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability of the year, **CVE-2025-10585**, which affects the V8 JavaScript engine and has been actively exploited in the wild. WatchGuard has disclosed a critical remote code execution vulnerability in their Firebox firewalls that requires immediate patching. Additionally, the ShinyHunters extortion group has executed a massive data breach affecting Salesforce customers, claiming to have stolen 1.5 billion records from 760 companies through compromised OAuth tokens. Threat actor TA558 continues targeting hospitality sectors with AI-generated scripts deploying the Venom RAT, while several major organizations including SonicWall and Insight Partners have reported significant security breaches affecting thousands of users.
