# Exploitation Report

During the past week threat actors have concentrated on high-impact remote-code-execution and privilege-bypass vulnerabilities across enterprise edge appliances, cloud collaboration tools, and embedded platforms.  Active campaigns are leveraging a critical Citrix NetScaler flaw (CVE-2025-5777) and a Wing FTP Server RCE (CVE-2025-47812) to gain initial access, while proof-of-concept exploits for Fortinet FortiWeb (CVE-2025-25257) are rapidly weaponizing.  Supply-chain compromises in WordPress Gravity Forms and leaked Laravel **APP_KEYs** are expanding the attack surface for web applications, and researchers have verified novel attacks on Kigen eSIMs, Google Gemini, and NVIDIA GPUs.  The U.S. CISA has added the Citrix vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, underscoring the urgency for immediate patching and mitigations across affected environments.

- **Status**: Proof-of-concept published; NVIDIA advises enabling system-level ECC and firmware updates.

### Laravel APP_KEY Exposure
- **Description**: Hundreds of public GitHub repositories leaked **APP_KEYs**, enabling attackers to forge encrypted cookies and execute code in Laravel apps.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, database theft, and full application compromise on at least 600 identified sites.
- **Status**: Exploitation confirmed by researchers; admins must rotate keys and redeploy secrets.

### PerfektBlue – OpenSynergy BlueSDK Bluetooth Bugs
- **Description**: Four vulnerabilities in BlueSDK permitting 1-click Bluetooth remote code execution over Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and BLE.
- **Impact**: RCE in 350 million vehicles and over 1 billion industrial, medical, and consumer devices; potential for car hijacking.
- **Status**: No active exploitation reported yet; vendors issuing firmware patches.

### WordPress Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: Official Gravity Forms download packages replaced with backdoored versions after developer site compromise.
- **Impact**: Secondary payload download, web-shell deployment, and database exfiltration on WordPress sites installing the tainted plugin.
- **Status**: Ongoing; malicious installers pulled, incident under investigation.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Session Token Replay (Citrix Bleed 2)**  
  - **Vector**: Unauthenticated HTTP requests leak memory segments containing valid session cookies, which are replayed to gain admin access.

- **Crafted HTTP Payload RCE (Wing FTP Server)**  
  - **Vector**: Malformed parameter in administrative endpoint triggers command injection.

- **Pre-Auth SQL Injection (FortiWeb)**  
  - **Vector**: Specially crafted URL parameters executed before authentication, escalating to OS-level commands.

- **SIM Profile Cloning (Kigen eSIM)**  
  - **Vector**: Abuse of remote-SIM-provisioning messages to inject rogue profiles and intercept traffic.

- **Prompt Injection (Google Gemini)**  
  - **Vector**: Manipulated email content coerces Gemini to insert malicious summaries containing phishing links.

- **RowHammer Bit Flip (GPUHammer)**  
  - **Vector**: Rapid row activations in GDDR6 induce bit flips, corrupting model parameters during AI workloads.

- **Cookie Forgery (Laravel APP_KEY Exposure)**  
  - **Vector**: Stolen `APP_KEY` allows forging encrypted session cookies leading to arbitrary code execution routes.

- **Bluetooth L2CAP Exploit (PerfektBlue)**  
  - **Vector**: One-click link opening over Bluetooth triggers overflow in BlueSDK stack.

- **Compromised Plugin Supply Chain (Gravity Forms)**  
  - **Vector**: Users download trojanized ZIP package directly from developer site, installing PHP backdoor.
