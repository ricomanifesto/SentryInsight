# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting enterprise infrastructure and mobile platforms. Russian threat actors are actively exploiting patched Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities to deploy stealer malware, while new ransomware variants are successfully bypassing endpoint detection and response systems. Additionally, critical vulnerabilities in Cisco's Firewall Management Center pose immediate risks to network security infrastructure, and sophisticated mobile phishing campaigns are targeting financial services with advanced cashout schemes.

## Active Exploitation Details

### MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows that allows threat actors to deploy malicious payloads
- **Impact**: Enables deployment of information-stealing malware and establishes persistent access to compromised systems
- **Status**: Patched by Microsoft, but actively exploited by threat actors despite patch availability

### Cisco Firewall Management Center RADIUS Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical remote code execution vulnerability in the RADIUS subsystem of Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center software
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on affected systems
- **Status**: Recently patched by Cisco with maximum severity rating (CVSS 10.0), no mitigation or workaround available

### EDR Bypass Techniques
- **Description**: Advanced techniques used by Crypto24 ransomware to circumvent endpoint detection and response systems
- **Impact**: Allows ransomware deployment while evading security controls
- **Status**: Actively exploited with demonstrated deep technical knowledge and skills

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Windows**: Systems vulnerable to MSC EvilTwin exploitation for malware deployment
- **Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center**: RADIUS subsystem affected by critical RCE vulnerability
- **Android Banking Applications**: Targeted by ERMAC 3.0 banking trojan with exposed infrastructure
