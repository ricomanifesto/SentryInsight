## Exploited Vulnerabilities and Threats

### 1. Malicious NPM Packages
- **Description**: 60 malicious packages were discovered in the NPM index, designed to collect sensitive host and network data and send it to a Discord webhook controlled by threat actors.
- **Affected Systems**: Systems using the compromised NPM packages.
- **Mitigation**: Regularly audit dependencies, use tools to detect malicious packages, and monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

### 2. ClickFix Technique
- **Description**: Hackers are using TikTok videos to distribute Vidar and StealC malware via the ClickFix technique, a social engineering method.
- **Affected Systems**: Users who interact with malicious TikTok content.
- **Mitigation**: Educate users on the risks of social engineering, implement robust endpoint protection, and monitor for unusual network activity.

### 3. Versa's Concerto Orchestrator Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Three severe zero-day vulnerabilities in Versa's Concerto Orchestrator could allow attackers to compromise the application and host system.
- **Affected Systems**: Versa's Concerto Orchestrator.
- **Mitigation**: Apply patches released by Versa, monitor systems for signs of compromise, and restrict access to critical systems.

### 4. Cisco Flaw Exploited by ViciousTrap
- **Description**: A threat actor named ViciousTrap exploited a Cisco flaw to compromise 5,300 network edge devices, creating a global honeypot.
- **Affected Systems**: Cisco network edge devices.
- **Mitigation**: Apply Cisco's security updates, monitor network traffic for anomalies, and isolate compromised devices.

### 5. GitLab Duo Vulnerability
- **Description**: An indirect prompt injection flaw in GitLab's AI assistant Duo allowed attackers to hijack AI responses and potentially steal source code.
