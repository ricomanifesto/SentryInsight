# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco infrastructure are currently under active attack, prompting CISA to issue emergency directives for immediate patching. Attackers are exploiting multiple Cisco firewall and networking vulnerabilities to compromise network appliances that cannot run traditional endpoint detection solutions. Nation-state actors, including Chinese APT groups, are leveraging these infrastructure compromises alongside custom backdoors to target government agencies and private sector organizations globally. The exploitation landscape also includes attacks on enterprise applications, supply chain compromises through malicious packages, and AI platform vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data through prompt injection techniques.
