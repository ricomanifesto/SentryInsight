# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting multiple platforms with significant security implications. Samsung has addressed a critical zero-day vulnerability affecting Android devices that was actively exploited in the wild. Meanwhile, CISA has issued warnings about ongoing exploitation of a critical remote code execution flaw in Dassault's DELMIA Apriso manufacturing software. Additionally, cybercriminal groups UNC6040 and UNC6395 are conducting sophisticated data theft campaigns targeting Salesforce platforms, while Apple users in France are facing their fourth spyware campaign of 2025. A new ransomware strain called HybridPetya has emerged with capabilities to bypass UEFI Secure Boot protections.
