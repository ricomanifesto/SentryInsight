# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting diverse platforms and systems. Most notably, Apple has patched a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) that was actively exploited in sophisticated attacks against targeted individuals, potentially indicating nation-state or spyware operations. Chinese state-sponsored threat actors continue aggressive campaigns, with Murky Panda (Silk Typhoon) exploiting cloud trust relationships to compromise downstream customers, while APT36 has developed new attack vectors using Linux .desktop files to target government and defense entities. Additionally, multiple cybercriminal campaigns are leveraging GeoServer vulnerabilities and exposed Redis servers for various malicious activities, and a new Mac-targeting infostealer called Shamos is being distributed through fake troubleshooting guides.
