# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals a sophisticated landscape of active exploitation targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. The Akira ransomware group is conducting a broad campaign against SonicWall VPN devices, successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication protections. Meanwhile, threat actors are leveraging AI-generated code in advanced phishing campaigns using malicious SVG files to evade email security systems. The emergence of the first malicious MCP (Model Context Protocol) server represents a new attack vector targeting AI-integrated environments. Additionally, China-linked threat actors are deploying PlugX and Bookworm malware against telecommunications and ASEAN networks, while Iranian state hackers are utilizing legitimate SSL certificates to sign malware for enhanced evasion capabilities.

## Active Exploitation Details
