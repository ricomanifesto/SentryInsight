# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple enterprise platforms, with significant impacts on organizations worldwide. The most severe incidents involve Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61882) being exploited by the Clop ransomware gang for data theft attacks, a Zimbra Collaboration zero-day (CVE-2025-27915) targeting Brazilian military systems, and Storm-1175 leveraging a maximum severity GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability in Medusa ransomware campaigns. These attacks demonstrate sophisticated threat actors exploiting zero-day flaws to achieve remote code execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise before patches become available.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day
- **Description**: Critical security flaw allowing unauthenticated remote code execution in Oracle's E-Business Suite
- **Impact**: Attackers can achieve complete system compromise and data theft without authentication
- **Status**: Zero-day actively exploited by Clop ransomware gang; Oracle has released emergency patch
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-61882

### Zimbra Collaboration Suite Zero-Day
- **Description**: Security vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration exploited via malicious ICS (iCalendar) files
- **Impact**: Targeted attacks against military systems, allowing system compromise through calendar attachments
- **Status**: Previously zero-day, now patched; was exploited earlier this year
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-27915

### GoAnywhere MFT Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: Maximum severity vulnerability in GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer solution
- **Impact**: Enables ransomware deployment and system compromise
- **Status**: Actively exploited by Storm-1175 group in Medusa ransomware attacks for nearly a month

### Redis Critical Remote Code Execution Flaw
- **Description**: Maximum severity vulnerability affecting thousands of Redis instances
- **Impact**: Remote code execution allowing complete system compromise
- **Status**: Patches released; thousands of vulnerable instances remain exposed

### Unity Game Engine Code Execution Flaw
- **Description**: Code execution vulnerability in Unity game engine
- **Impact**: Code execution on Android devices and privilege escalation on Windows systems
- **Status**: Steam and Microsoft have issued warnings; affects gaming applications

## Affected Systems and Products
