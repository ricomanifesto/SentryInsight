# Exploitation Report

A surge of high-impact exploitation activity is underway across enterprise networking, cloud, and security appliances. A newly disclosed critical flaw in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) allows unauthenticated network-based attackers to run commands as root, while fully patched SonicWall appliances are being compromised in the wild through a previously unknown zero-day to deliver the “Overstep” backdoor for ransomware staging. Oracle has also rushed out emergency fixes for a vulnerability in its Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Code Editor that exposed entire developer environments to takeover. Concurrently, the Matanbuchus 3.0 malware loader is being pushed via Microsoft Teams chats, showing threat actors’ continued pivot toward collaboration-platform abuse. Enterprises running Cisco ISE, SonicWall firewalls, or Oracle Cloud developer tooling should expedite patching or compensating controls and monitor for post-exploitation indicators immediately.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco ISE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
- **Description**: A maximum-severity flaw within Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) web-based management services permits unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests that bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.  
- **Impact**: Full system compromise, lateral movement into network segments gated by ISE, ability to modify authentication policies, harvest credentials, and deploy additional payloads.  
- **Status**: Cisco has released fixed versions and urges immediate upgrade; exploitation has not yet been confirmed publicly but is rated critical and remotely reachable, making rapid weaponisation likely.  

### SonicWall Zero-Day Enabling “Overstep” Backdoor Deployment
- **Description**: Threat actors are exploiting an undocumented vulnerability against fully patched SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) and next-generation firewall appliances. The flaw provides privileged code execution, allowing installation of the custom “Overstep” backdoor.  
- **Impact**: Persistence on perimeter security devices, network pivoting, credential interception, and delivery of Abyss-family ransomware across internal hosts.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited zero-day with no vendor patch at the time of reporting; SonicWall is investigating and recommends disabling management interfaces from the Internet and enabling IPS signatures.  

### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Code Editor Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical security weakness in OCI’s web-based Code Editor allowed attackers to escape the editor’s sandbox, gain the user’s cloud identity, and access or modify any resources tied to the compromised tenancy.  
- **Impact**: Complete takeover of developer pipelines, insertion of malicious code into CI/CD processes, credential theft, and potential cross-tenant impact.  
- **Status**: Oracle has patched the service; no reported in-the-wild exploitation prior to fix release but the low-complexity attack path increases the risk of post-disclosure mass scanning.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) & ISE-PIC**  
  - **Platform**: Physical and virtual ISE appliances running vulnerable software releases across on-prem and cloud deployments  

- **SonicWall SMA & Next-Generation Firewall Appliances**  
  - **Platform**: Hardware and virtual devices running the latest (at-the-time) firmware; management interface exposed internally or externally  

- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Code Editor**  
  - **Platform**: All OCI regions where Code Editor is enabled for developer tenancies  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Unauthenticated REST/HTTP Exploit (Cisco ISE)**  
  - **Vector**: Direct network requests to ISE administrative endpoints weaponising input-validation flaws for command injection  

- **Perimeter Appliance Zero-Day Abuse (SonicWall)**  
  - **Vector**: Remote exploitation of an undisclosed vulnerability in the SSL-VPN / management interface to drop the “Overstep” ELF payload  

- **Cloud IDE Sandbox Escape (OCI Code Editor)**  
  - **Vector**: Crafted project files and API calls that break out of the integrated code workspace, hijacking the user’s cloud session token  

- **Collaboration-Platform Malware Delivery (Microsoft Teams → Matanbuchus 3.0)**  
  - **Vector**: Spear-phishing via Teams chat messages containing malicious MSI installers that leverage the loader’s new EDR-evasion and DNS-tunneled C2 capabilities  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Abyss Ransomware-Linked Group**  
  - **Campaign**: Leveraging SonicWall zero-day to implant “Overstep,” perform reconnaissance, and launch targeted ransomware attacks against organisations relying on SonicWall perimeter gear  

- **Matanbuchus 3.0 Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Using Microsoft Teams as an initial access channel to distribute an upgraded loader featuring endpoint-detection-response (EDR) discovery, dynamic configuration fetching, and DNS-based command-and-control to stage subsequent ransomware payloads  

- **ShinyHunters (Suspected)**  
  - **Campaign**: Breach of Louis Vuitton regional systems resulting in multi-country customer data exposure; activity underscores ongoing data-theft operations but is not tied to a specific vulnerability disclosed in this cycle
