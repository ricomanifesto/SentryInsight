## Exploited Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

### 1. **Fake VPN and Browser NSIS Installers Delivering Winos 4.0 Malware**
- **Description**: Cybercriminals are using fake software installers masquerading as popular tools like LetsVPN and QQ Browser to deliver the Winos 4.0 malware framework.
- **Impact**: This campaign targets users by tricking them into downloading malicious installers, leading to system compromise.
- **Mitigation**: Users should verify the authenticity of software sources and use reputable antivirus solutions to detect and block malicious downloads.

### 2. **Bumblebee Malware via SEO Poisoning**
- **Description**: The Bumblebee malware is being distributed through SEO poisoning campaigns, targeting IT staff by impersonating popular open-source projects like Zenmap and WinMRT.
- **Impact**: This technique exploits users searching for legitimate software, leading to malware infections.
- **Mitigation**: IT staff should be cautious of search results and verify the legitimacy of software downloads from official sources.

### 3. **Malicious NPM Packages Collecting Host and Network Data**
- **Description**: 60 malicious packages on NPM have been discovered collecting sensitive host and network data and sending it to a Discord webhook controlled by threat actors.
- **Impact**: Developers using these packages may unknowingly expose sensitive data.
- **Mitigation**: Regularly audit dependencies and use tools like npm audit to identify and remove malicious packages.

### 4. **ClickFix Technique Distributing Vidar and StealC Malware via TikTok**
- **Description**: Cybercriminals are using TikTok videos to distribute Vidar and StealC malware through a social engineering technique known as ClickFix.
- **Impact**: This method exploits users' trust in social media platforms to spread malware.
- **Mitigation**: Users should be cautious of links in social media content and use security software to detect and block malicious activity.

### 5. **ViciousTrap Using Cisco Flaw to Build Global Honeypot**
- **Description**: A threat actor named ViciousTrap has exploited a Cisco vulnerability to compromise 5,300 network edge devices, creating a global honeypot network.
- **Impact**: This exploitation allows attackers to monitor and manipulate network traffic across compromised devices.
- **Mitigation**: Organizations should apply Cisco's security patches promptly and monitor network traffic for unusual activity.

### 6. **GitLab Duo Vulnerability**
- **Description**: An indirect prompt injection flaw in GitLab's AI assistant Duo could allow attackers to hijack AI responses and inject unauthorized commands.
- **Impact**: This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation.
- **Mitigation**: Apply security updates from GitLab and monitor AI interactions for suspicious activity.

### 7. **CISA Warning on Broader SaaS Attacks**
- **Description**: CISA has warned of cyber threat activity targeting applications hosted in Microsoft Azure, exploiting app secrets and cloud misconfigurations.
- **Impact**: These attacks can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches in cloud environments.
- **Mitigation**: Regularly review and secure cloud configurations, and use tools to detect and remediate misconfigurations.

## Notable Threat Actors

- **ViciousTrap**: Known for exploiting Cisco vulnerabilities to create a global honeypot network.
- **Silent Ransom Group**: Engaged in extortion attacks targeting U.S. law firms using social engineering techniques.

## Recommendations for Mitigation
