# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape has seen intense exploitation activity with multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and nation-state campaigns targeting critical infrastructure. F5 disclosed a significant breach where nation-state actors stole undisclosed BIG-IP vulnerabilities and source code, highlighting the severity of supply chain compromises. Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addressed 172 security holes including three actively exploited zero-days, with one affecting every Windows version ever shipped. Chinese threat actors have been particularly active, with groups like Flax Typhoon compromising ArcGIS servers for persistent backdoor access and Jewelbug infiltrating Russian IT networks. Additionally, the Clop ransomware group exploited Oracle zero-days to breach Harvard University, while ICTBroadcast servers face active exploitation through cookie-based attacks.

- **Impact**: Attackers gained access to previously unknown vulnerabilities and proprietary source code, potentially enabling widespread exploitation of BIG-IP systems
- **Status**: F5 has released security updates to address the stolen vulnerabilities detected on August 9, 2025

### Oracle Zero-Day Exploits
- **Description**: Zero-day vulnerabilities in Oracle systems exploited by the Clop ransomware group
- **Impact**: Successful breach of Harvard University systems and data theft as part of a broader campaign against Oracle customers
- **Status**: Active exploitation ongoing with Harvard University confirming the breach

### ICTBroadcast Cookie Exploitation
- **Description**: Critical security flaw in ICTBroadcast autodialer software from ICT Innovations being actively exploited via cookie manipulation
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain remote shell access to compromised servers
- **Status**: Active exploitation detected in the wild

### SAP NetWeaver Command Execution Vulnerability
