# Exploitation Report

Security researchers are currently tracking significant in-the-wild exploitation of a critical SAP NetWeaver flaw that is being used to gain initial access to enterprise servers and deploy the Linux “Auto-Color” malware.  Concurrently, ransomware operators are expanding their tooling, with the Gunra gang introducing a Linux variant that can target VMware and other Unix-like systems.  Complementary social-engineering campaigns such as “choicejacking” on mobile devices and a phishing wave against PyPI developers show a broadening attacker focus on both infrastructure vulnerabilities and human-factor weaknesses.

## Active Exploitation Details

### SAP NetWeaver Auto-Color Exploit
- **Description**: Attackers abuse a critical authentication-bypass vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for Java to upload and execute malicious components (“Auto-Color” malware) through the `/AutoPic/Color.do` endpoint.  
- **Impact**: Full remote code execution on SAP servers, installation of persistent Linux malware, lateral movement inside corporate networks, exfiltration of sensitive intellectual property.  
- **Status**: Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation; SAP has released security fixes and customers are urged to apply them immediately and monitor for IOCs related to “Auto-Color.”  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-31324  

### Gunra Ransomware Linux Variant
- **Description**: The Gunra ransomware group—previously Windows-only—now leverages a new ELF payload capable of multithreaded encryption on Linux and ESXi systems.  Initial access is achieved via exposed management interfaces and exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in virtualization stacks.  
- **Impact**: Rapid encryption of virtual machine disk files (`.vmdk`, `.vhdx`) and shutdown of production workloads; follow-on extortion for decryption keys.  
- **Status**: Actively deployed in recent intrusions; no vendor patch because malware leverages existing misconfigurations and unpatched hosts rather than a single new CVE.  

### Mobile “Choicejacking” Abuse
- **Description**: A browser-based social-engineering technique that overlays deceptive dialog buttons (“Allow” vs. “Deny”) on Android devices, tricking users into granting permissions such as push-notification delivery or profile installation.  
- **Impact**: Silent installation of malicious configuration profiles, redirection to premium SMS services, or forced browser notifications leading to further malware.  
- **Status**: Increasingly observed on malicious advertising networks and compromised websites; mitigations include OS patch levels that restrict overlay permissions and heightened user awareness.  

### PyPI Credential-Phishing Campaign
- **Description**: Attackers send bogus “account verification” e-mails from a look-alike domain (`pypi-validation[.]org`) that funnel developers to counterfeit login pages, stealing PyPI credentials and session cookies.  
- **Impact**: Account takeover, malicious library uploads, supply-chain compromise of downstream developers and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Status**: Ongoing; PyPI administrators have warned users and implemented temporary 2FA enforcement for targeted accounts.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **SAP NetWeaver AS-Java**: Versions prior to the security update addressing CVE-2025-31324  
  - **Platform**: On-premises SAP application servers running on Linux/UNIX variants  
- **VMware ESXi & General Linux Servers** (Gunra ransomware targets)  
  - **Platform**: vSphere/ESXi hypervisors, mainstream Linux distributions  
- **Android Smartphones and Tablets** (Choicejacking)  
  - **Platform**: Android 10–14 with default browser or Chrome-based browsers that allow overlay dialogs  
- **Python Package Index (PyPI) Accounts**  
  - **Platform**: Any developer workstation or CI environment using PyPI authentication  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Authentication Bypass via `/AutoPic/Color.do`**  
  - **Vector**: Crafted HTTP requests exploit CVE-2025-31324 to skip logon checks and upload malicious Java components.  

- **Multithreaded ELF Ransomware Deployment**  
  - **Vector**: SSH brute force, exploitation of outdated virtualization management interfaces, or stolen admin credentials to drop Gunra’s Linux payload.  

- **Choicejacking Overlay Attack**  
  - **Vector**: Malicious JavaScript creates full-screen overlays, misaligning visible buttons with actual click targets to trick users into consenting to harmful actions.  

- **Look-alike Domain Phishing**  
  - **Vector**: E-mails spoofing PyPI security notices redirect victims to a visually identical login portal served over HTTPS, harvesting credentials.  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unknown SAP-Focused Intrusion Set**  
  - **Campaign**: Targeted a U.S. chemicals firm, weaponizing CVE-2025-31324 to deploy Auto-Color malware for persistence and data theft.  

- **Gunra Ransomware Group**  
  - **Campaign**: Expanding beyond Windows to cross-platform attacks; observed encrypting VMware infrastructure and demanding seven-figure ransoms from manufacturing and healthcare verticals.  

- **Choicejacking Fraud Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Broad, opportunistic web-ad campaigns that monetize forced subscriptions and drive-by installs, primarily affecting mobile users in North America and Europe.  

- **PyPI Phishing Operators (“Snake-Repo” cluster)**  
  - **Campaign**: Credential-harvesting effort aimed at popular package maintainers to inject malicious code into widely used libraries, thereby compromising supply chains.  

**Bold, immediate patching of SAP NetWeaver systems and rigorous monitoring of Linux/ESXi servers remain the highest priorities, while user-focused defenses (MFA, security training) are essential against the parallel rise in social-engineering attacks.**
