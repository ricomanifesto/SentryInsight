# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape is dominated by rapid weaponization of newly disclosed remote-code-execution flaws and opportunistic supply-chain compromises. Within hours of public disclosure, attackers began exploiting critical vulnerabilities in Wing FTP Server, Fortinet FortiWeb appliances, and Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway (“CitrixBleed 2”), enabling full system takeover without authentication. Parallel to these server-side attacks, novel techniques such as GPUHammer (a GPU-focused RowHammer variant) and the “PerfektBlue” Bluetooth attack chain showcase expanding hardware attack surfaces. Cloud and SaaS platforms are also under fire: researchers demonstrated how Google Gemini for Workspace can be hijacked to deliver persuasive phishing lures, while leaked Laravel APP_KEYs and a backdoored Gravity Forms distribution illustrate how minor misconfigurations or supply-chain intrusions translate directly into remote code execution. Threat actors like the Iranian-linked Pay2Key ransomware crew are actively incentivizing affiliates to exploit these weaknesses, underscoring the urgency for immediate patching, hardening, and continuous monitoring.
