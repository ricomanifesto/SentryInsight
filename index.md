# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical security incidents requiring immediate attention. WhatsApp has issued an emergency update to address a zero-click vulnerability that was actively exploited in targeted attacks against iOS and macOS devices. This vulnerability was exploited in conjunction with a recently disclosed Apple flaw, demonstrating sophisticated attack chaining techniques. Additionally, threat actors are leveraging legitimate forensic tools like Velociraptor to deploy Visual Studio Code for command and control tunneling, while the TamperedChef infostealer is being distributed through fraudulent PDF editing applications promoted via Google ads. Security researchers have also identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Sitecore Experience Platform that could enable cache poisoning and remote code execution attacks.
