# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security concerns across multiple domains. Most notably, Commvault systems face severe pre-authentication vulnerabilities that could enable remote code execution attacks, while AI-powered systems like Perplexity's Comet browser are susceptible to prompt injection attacks that could expose user data. Additionally, threat actors continue to leverage legitimate infrastructure for malicious purposes, with the Scattered Spider collective facing legal consequences for their high-profile cyberattacks, and ransomware groups like Warlock actively targeting telecommunications companies.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Commvault Pre-Authentication Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Four security gaps in Commvault systems that can be chained together to achieve remote code execution without authentication
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable Commvault instances
- **Status**: Updates have been released by Commvault to address these vulnerabilities

### Perplexity Comet AI Browser Prompt Injection
- **Description**: Vulnerability in Perplexity's Comet AI browser that allows attackers to inject malicious commands through prompt manipulation
- **Impact**: Attackers can potentially gain access to users' personal data by embedding malicious commands within legitimate prompts
- **Status**: Actively exploitable vulnerability identified by Brave security researchers

### ChatGPT Downgrade Attack
- **Description**: Attack technique that uses brief, plain clues in prompts to force ChatGPT to query older, less secure models
- **Impact**: Undermines GPT-5 security measures by forcing the system to use older models with weaker security controls
- **Status**: Currently exploitable attack vector affecting ChatGPT systems

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Commvault Systems**: Multiple versions affected by pre-authentication exploit chains
- **Perplexity Comet AI Browser**: AI-powered browser vulnerable to prompt injection attacks
- **ChatGPT/OpenAI Systems**: Susceptible to downgrade attacks that bypass newer security measures
- **Colt Technology Services**: UK telecommunications company affected by Warlock ransomware
- **EV Smart Charging Infrastructure**: ISO 15118 standard implementations pose cyber risks
- **Virtual Private Server (VPS) Infrastructure**: Legitimate VPS services being abused by threat actors

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Pre-Authentication Exploit Chaining**: Multiple vulnerabilities combined to achieve remote code execution without authentication
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious commands embedded within AI system prompts to manipulate behavior
- **AI Model Downgrade**: Forcing AI systems to use older, less secure models through prompt manipulation
- **Ransomware Operations**: Data theft and auction tactics employed by ransomware groups
- **VPS Infrastructure Abuse**: Legitimate virtual private server services exploited for malicious infrastructure
- **Insider Threats**: Custom malware and kill switches deployed by malicious insiders

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Scattered Spider Collective**: High-profile cybercriminal group with member Noah Michael Urban sentenced to 10 years in prison for cyberattacks
- **Warlock Ransomware Gang**: Actively targeting telecommunications companies, confirmed data theft from Colt Technology Services with files being auctioned
- **Malicious Insiders**: Software developer sentenced to 4 years for creating kill switches and sabotaging ex-employer's Windows network systems
- **VPS Abusers**: Threat actors leveraging legitimate virtual private server infrastructure for stealth operations and rapid deployment of malicious services
