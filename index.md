# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting TP-Link wireless routers and social media platforms, with threat actors leveraging both traditional vulnerabilities and novel AI-based techniques. CISA has flagged two TP-Link router vulnerabilities as actively exploited, while cybercriminals are exploiting X's Grok AI system to bypass platform protections and spread malware to millions of users. Additionally, state-sponsored groups including Russia's APT28 and Iran's MOIS are conducting sophisticated campaigns targeting government entities and organizations worldwide using advanced malware and phishing techniques.

## Active Exploitation Details

### TP-Link Router Authentication Bypass
- **Description**: Security flaws in TP-Link wireless routers allowing unauthorized access and control
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain administrative access to network infrastructure, potentially compromising entire networks
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild, added to CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2023-50224, CVE-2025-9377

### X Platform Grok AI Abuse
- **Description**: Cybercriminals are exploiting X's Grok AI assistant to bypass the platform's malvertising protections
- **Impact**: Enables widespread distribution of malicious links to millions of users while evading detection systems
- **Status**: Ongoing exploitation campaign targeting social media users

### Microsoft Outlook Backdoor Campaign
- **Description**: Russia's APT28 group is deploying 'NotDoor' malware specifically targeting Microsoft Outlook
- **Impact**: Enables covert data exfiltration from compromised email systems
- **Status**: Active state-sponsored campaign

## Affected Systems and Products

- **TP-Link Wireless Routers**: Multiple router models affected by authentication bypass vulnerabilities
