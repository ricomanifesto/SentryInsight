# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape is dominated by several critical exploitation activities across multiple vectors. CISA has issued urgent warnings about a critical Sudo flaw being actively exploited in Linux and Unix systems, while Akira ransomware operators are conducting broad campaigns targeting SonicWall VPN devices, successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication protections. Nation-state actors, particularly China-linked groups, are deploying PlugX and Bookworm malware variants against telecommunications infrastructure in Central and South Asian countries. Additionally, threat actors are leveraging AI technologies for sophisticated phishing campaigns, using LLM-generated code to create obfuscated SVG files that evade traditional email security measures. The emergence of the first malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server represents a novel supply chain attack vector, while Android banking trojans like Datzbro are targeting elderly users through AI-generated social media content.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Critical Sudo Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical security flaw in the Sudo command-line utility for Linux and Unix-like operating systems that is being actively exploited in the wild
- **Impact**: Enables privilege escalation and unauthorized system access
- **Status**: CISA has added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, indicating active exploitation

### VMware NSX High-Severity Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Two high-severity vulnerabilities in VMware NSX infrastructure reported by the U.S. National Security Agency
- **Impact**: Could allow attackers to compromise network virtualization infrastructure
- **Status**: Patches released by Broadcom to address the NSA-reported vulnerabilities

### SonicWall VPN Authentication Bypass
- **Description**: Vulnerability in SonicWall SSL VPN devices allowing authentication bypass even with MFA protection
