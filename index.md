# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day exploitation activity has escalated with Google patching CVE-2025-10585, an actively exploited Chrome vulnerability affecting the V8 JavaScript engine. Simultaneously, CISA has issued urgent warnings about malware strains targeting Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428. Threat actors continue to exploit enterprise infrastructure through sophisticated campaigns, including Russian groups collaborating on backdoor deployments and the emergence of new malware loaders targeting ransomware operations. The threat landscape is further complicated by supply chain attacks targeting developer ecosystems and credential theft operations affecting major cloud services.
