# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape analysis reveals significant active exploitation activities across multiple attack vectors. The ShinyHunters extortion group has executed a massive data theft operation targeting Salesforce records through compromised OAuth tokens, while the TA558 threat actor has deployed AI-generated attack scripts to deliver Venom RAT in targeted campaigns against Brazilian hotels. Additionally, several major security incidents have been reported, including ransomware attacks against Insight Partners and credential theft operations through the disrupted RaccoonO365 phishing service. The emergence of AI-powered attack techniques and evolving ClickFix malware variants demonstrates the increasing sophistication of current threat actor operations.
