# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently under active exploitation across multiple enterprise systems, with CISA issuing urgent patching directives for federal agencies. The most severe threats include a critical SAP S/4HANA vulnerability that allows complete system compromise with minimal effort, and a Sitecore vulnerability that has prompted emergency patching orders. Additionally, malicious actors are leveraging npm package repositories to distribute cryptocurrency wallet-stealing malware targeting Ethereum developers, while sophisticated malware-as-a-service operations continue to evolve with novel remote access tools.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Critical SAP S/4HANA Vulnerability
