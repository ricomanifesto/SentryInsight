# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. CISA has added three actively exploited vulnerabilities affecting Citrix Session Recording and Git to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, indicating ongoing attacks against these systems. The HOOK Android banking trojan has evolved to include ransomware-style overlays and expanded its command capabilities to 107 remote commands, representing a significant escalation in mobile malware sophistication. Additionally, threat actors are conducting coordinated scanning campaigns targeting Microsoft RDP authentication servers, while the China-nexus group UNC6384 continues deploying PlugX malware through captive portal hijacks against diplomatic targets. Apple has also issued urgent security updates warning of a dangerous vulnerability that may have already been exploited in sophisticated attacks targeting specific individuals.
