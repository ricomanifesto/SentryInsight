# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities have been identified. The most significant threat involves a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway products (CVE-2025-7775) that was actively exploited before patches were available. Additionally, sophisticated threat actors including Silk Typhoon and Blind Eagle are conducting targeted campaigns using advanced techniques such as captive portal hijacking and multi-cluster operations. A widespread OAuth token theft campaign has also compromised Salesloft platforms, exposing Salesforce customer data through exploitation of Drift AI chat agent vulnerabilities.

## Active Exploitation Details
