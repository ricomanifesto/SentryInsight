# Exploitation Report

Current threat intelligence reveals a surge in sophisticated cyberattack campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and organizations globally. The Akira ransomware group is actively exploiting SonicWall VPN vulnerabilities, successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication to breach enterprise networks. Meanwhile, threat actors are leveraging artificial intelligence to craft advanced phishing campaigns using malicious SVG files and deploying new malware families including EvilAI, which masquerades as legitimate AI tools. State-sponsored groups, particularly Iranian and Chinese APTs, are intensifying their operations with PlugX malware variants targeting Asian telecommunications networks and using fraudulent SSL certificates to sign malicious code. The emergence of the first malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server represents a novel attack vector in AI integration environments.
