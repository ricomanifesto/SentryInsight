# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting multiple high-value systems across various sectors. The most significant threat involves active exploitation of a critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2025-6543) that has been used to breach critical organizations in the Netherlands. Additionally, a WinRAR zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-8088) has been exploited by the Russian RomCom hacking group to deliver malware through path traversal attacks. Ransomware operations continue to pose substantial threats, with the Interlock ransomware gang successfully compromising Saint Paul's municipal systems, while law enforcement has disrupted BlackSuit ransomware infrastructure. The cybercrime landscape shows concerning collaboration patterns, with ShinyHunters adopting tactics similar to the notorious Scattered Spider group, indicating potential coordination between major threat actors.
