# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals significant exploitation activity across multiple sectors, with particular focus on infrastructure vulnerabilities and sophisticated malware campaigns. Chinese state-sponsored actors have demonstrated persistent exploitation of VMware systems for nearly a year, while new Android banking trojans like Klopatra are actively compromising thousands of devices across Europe. Critical vulnerabilities in enterprise systems including OneLogin IAM solutions and Red Hat OpenShift AI are exposing organizations to complete infrastructure takeover. Industrial router compromises are being leveraged for large-scale SMS phishing campaigns, and advanced memory-based attacks against Intel SGX are demonstrating new hardware-level exploitation techniques.

## Active Exploitation Details

### VMware Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
