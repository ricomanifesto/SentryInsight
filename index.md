# Exploitation Report

A review of this week’s security coverage shows an uptick in active exploitation against the software-supply chain, telecommunications infrastructure, and mobile platforms. Threat actors are abusing GitHub to weaponize open-source projects, launching record-setting DDoS attacks, and leveraging novel techniques such as on-device virtualization to hijack Android banking apps. High-profile groups—including Lazarus, Salt Typhoon, Scattered Spider, and the Qilin ransomware collective—continue to monetize these vulnerabilities through cryptocurrency theft, data exfiltration, and double-extortion tactics. The incidents below highlight the most critical exploitation activity now observed in the wild.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Malicious Copycat Repositories on GitHub  
- **Description**: Adversaries clone popular open-source projects and insert malicious payloads before publishing them under look-alike names.  
- **Impact**: Developers unknowingly import backdoored code, giving attackers remote access, credential theft capability, and a foothold in downstream production environments.  
- **Status**: More than 60 new repositories detected this week; GitHub is actively removing them, but the campaign remains ongoing.  

### Trojanized GitHub Repositories Targeting Gamers & Developers  
- **Description**: Over 200 trojanized Python “hacking tools” deliver infostealers when executed. The lure specifically targets gamers, pentesters, and junior developers looking for game cheats or security scripts.  
- **Impact**: Credential theft, Discord token harvesting, and system takeover.  
- **Status**: Still live; researchers report 3,700+ infected hosts across 273 campaigns.  

### Record-Breaking 7.3 Tbps DDoS Exploit  
- **Description**: Attackers chained multiple amplification vectors to reach 7.3 Tbps against a hosting provider. Cloudflare attributes success to a novel multi-vector methodology mixing volumetric floods with application-layer bursts.  
- **Impact**: Service outages, bandwidth saturation, collateral damage to co-hosted tenants.  
- **Status**: Mitigated in real time, but the technique is now circulating on DDoS-for-hire platforms.  

### On-Device Virtualization Abuse in Android (Godfather Malware)  
- **Description**: The latest Godfather variant spins up isolated virtual environments, sidestepping security controls and presenting fake overlays that harvest banking credentials.  
- **Impact**: Full account takeover, unauthorized wire transfers, and interception of MFA tokens.  
- **Status**: Active in the wild with infections reported across Europe and the Middle East; no platform patch available yet—mitigation requires app-store takedowns and endpoint protection updates.  

### AntiDot Android Malware Campaign  
- **Description**: Financially motivated actors deploy an overlay-based trojan that abuses NFC, virtualization, and Accessibility Services to steal data and conduct contactless payment fraud.  
- **Impact**: Theft of payment information, unauthorized NFC transactions, device enrolment in botnets.  
- **Status**: 3,775 devices compromised; Google Play Protect signatures updated but sideloaded APKs remain a threat.  

### OneDrive Search Functionality Bug  
- **Description**: A Microsoft OneDrive regression prevents local and cloud search, disrupting file visibility. Some reports indicate opportunistic phishing campaigns exploiting user confusion to deliver malicious “fix” executables.  
- **Impact**: Potential for social-engineering-driven malware installs; productivity loss.  
- **Status**: Microsoft investigating; no patch released.  

### Viasat Intrusion via Salt Typhoon  
- **Description**: Salt Typhoon (China-nexus) leveraged cloud misconfigurations to breach Viasat’s internal network. The actor’s goal was espionage rather than disruption, exfiltrating proprietary satellite telemetry.  
- **Impact**: Intellectual-property theft, potential downstream targeting of satellite customers.  
- **Status**: Intrusion confirmed; defensive hardening under way, indicators shared with government partners.  

### Scattered Spider Insurance-Sector Exploits  
- **Description**: Social-engineering specialists Scattered Spider used SIM-swapping and MFA-bypass to infiltrate Aflac and other insurers, accessing customer PII and policy data.  
- **Impact**: Data theft, extortion, reputational damage.  
- **Status**: Campaign active; insurers issuing breach notifications and strengthening identity verification.  

### Lazarus $11 Million Crypto Heist (BitoPro)  
- **Description**: North Korea’s Lazarus group compromised hot-wallet infrastructure at BitoPro, siphoning $11 million in digital assets. Initial access believed to stem from spear-phished developer credentials and privilege escalation inside exchange back-end APIs.  
- **Impact**: Direct financial loss, secondary market manipulation, user trust erosion.  
- **Status**: Funds laundered through mixers; exchange upgrading wallet segregation and key-management controls.  

### Qilin Ransomware “Call Lawyer” Extortion Tactic  
- **Description**: Qilin’s latest build includes an integrated video-chat link to a legal adviser, intensifying pressure on victims by threatening regulatory fines and class-action lawsuits if ransom demands aren’t met.  
- **Impact**: Higher ransom payouts, accelerated payment timelines, legal intimidation.  
- **Status**: Deployed in the wild; Qilin affiliates advertising $3 million+ average demands.
