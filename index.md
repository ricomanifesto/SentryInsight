# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple enterprise platforms, with threat actors targeting Oracle E-Business Suite (CVE-2025-61882), Zimbra Collaboration Suite (CVE-2025-27915), and GoAnywhere MFT systems. The Clop ransomware group has successfully compromised numerous Oracle customers through an unauthenticated remote code execution flaw, while sophisticated attacks against Brazilian military infrastructure utilized malicious ICS calendar files to exploit Zimbra systems. Additionally, ransomware operators are leveraging maximum severity vulnerabilities in file transfer solutions, and Redis instances face critical remote code execution risks affecting thousands of deployments worldwide.
