# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing a wave of critical zero-day exploitations, with threat actors actively targeting enterprise infrastructure through multiple attack vectors. Most notably, Cisco firewall devices are under active attack through CVE-2025-10023 and CVE-2025-10033, prompting CISA to issue emergency directives. Additionally, a maximum severity vulnerability CVE-2025-10035 in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT platform is being exploited as a zero-day, allowing remote command injection without authentication. Nation-state actors, including Iranian APT groups and Russian COLDRIVER, are deploying sophisticated malware campaigns while Chinese APT group UNC5221 is targeting edge devices with backdoor operations.
