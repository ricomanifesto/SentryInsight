# Exploitation Report

Over the last week, defenders observed a sharp uptick in successful intrusions that hinge on privilege-escalation flaws in Linux and remote-access weaknesses in enterprise VPN appliances.  China-nexus “Salt Typhoon” operators leveraged a newly patched command-injection bug in Ivanti Connect Secure to compromise satellite-communications provider Viasat, while opportunistic attackers and red-teamers are widely abusing a kernel OverlayFS bug to obtain root on multiple Linux distributions.  At the same time, researchers disclosed two additional local-root flaws in PAM and Udisks that are expected to see weaponisation shortly after proof-of-concept (PoC) code becomes public.  These vulnerabilities, coupled with novel social-engineering campaigns by BlueNoroff and APT29, illustrate a diverse exploitation landscape that blends zero-day abuse, rapid PoC adoption, and credential-theft trade-craft.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Linux OverlayFS Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: A logic error in the Linux kernel’s OverlayFS subsystem allows unprivileged users to copy up arbitrary file capabilities from a lower to an upper layer, leading to uncontrolled privilege inheritance.  
- **Impact**: Local attackers can elevate themselves to full root, escaping containers and gaining complete control of affected hosts.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild according to CISA; patches are available in upstream kernels and have been back-ported by major distributions.  

### Ivanti Connect Secure Remote Command Injection
- **Description**: An input-validation weakness in Ivanti Connect Secure (formerly Pulse Secure) enables unauthenticated command injection via crafted HTTP requests to the administrative web interface.  
- **Impact**: Remote adversaries can execute arbitrary system commands, pivot into internal networks, and harvest credentials and configuration data from the VPN appliance.  
- **Status**: Exploited by Salt Typhoon during the Viasat intrusion; Ivanti has released security updates and mitigations.  

### PAM “unix_chkpwd” Local Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: The helper binary `unix_chkpwd`, invoked by Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), improperly handles user-supplied arguments, permitting attackers to interact with sensitive memory regions owned by root.  
- **Impact**: Any low-privilege user able to run PAM-based authentication routines can escalate to super-user.  
- **Status**: Proof-of-concept code exists; distributions are issuing patches and advisory guidance.  

### Udisks2 DBus Service Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: Udisks2, responsible for block-device management over DBus, exposes a method that fails to sanitise path parameters, allowing symbolic-link manipulation and arbitrary file writes with elevated privileges.  
- **Impact**: Local users can overwrite root-owned files and subsequently achieve full system compromise.  
- **Status**: Publicly disclosed alongside the PAM flaw; vendor patches are being rolled out, but exploitation has not yet been confirmed in the wild.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Linux Kernel (OverlayFS)**: Kernel versions prior to the patched releases across Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Arch, Fedora, and container images based on these distros  
- **Ivanti Connect Secure / Policy Secure**: All supported firmware versions prior to the emergency hot-fix build published in the vendor advisory  
- **PAM (unix_chkpwd helper)**: Default installations on most GNU/Linux distributions shipping the pam_unix module  
- **Udisks2**: Versions shipped with GNOME-centric Linux distributions (Fedora 38/39, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, openSUSE, etc.) running the vulnerable DBus service  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Local Capability Copy (OverlayFS Abuse)**  
  - **Vector**: Userland code mounts OverlayFS layers and copies files with crafted extended attributes to obtain elevated capabilities.  

- **Unauthenticated Web Interface RCE (Ivanti VPN)**  
  - **Vector**: Malicious HTTP POST/GET requests inject OS commands through vulnerable CGI endpoints.  

- **Symbolic-Link File Overwrite (Udisks2)**  
  - **Vector**: Attacker crafts symlinks to sensitive files, then triggers privileged `udisksctl` operations to overwrite them.  

- **Helper Binary Manipulation (PAM unix_chkpwd)**  
  - **Vector**: Invocation of `unix_chkpwd` with specially crafted parameters to read or write privileged memory and spawn a root shell.  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Salt Typhoon (China)**  
  - **Campaign**: Breach of Viasat’s corporate network using the Ivanti Connect Secure command-injection flaw; subsequent data exfiltration and persistent access.  

- **BlueNoroff / TA444 (North Korea)**  
  - **Campaign**: Social-engineering of Web3 employees via deepfaked Zoom calls to deliver a macOS backdoor; leverages trust rather than software vulnerabilities.  

- **APT29 / Cozy Bear (Russia)**  
  - **Campaign**: Phishing operations abusing Google “application-specific passwords” to bypass two-factor authentication, enabling full email takeover of targeted organisations.  

- **Predatory Sparrow (Pro-Israel Hacktivists)**  
  - **Campaign**: Offensive operations against Iran’s Nobitex crypto-exchange culminating in the theft and destruction of approximately $90 million in cryptocurrency.  

- **Stargazers Ghost Network**  
  - **Campaign**: Distribution-as-a-service operation seeding malicious Minecraft mods on GitHub; installs Java-based infostealers that swipe credentials and browser tokens.
