## Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

1. **VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days**
   - **Source**: [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-vmware-esxi-microsoft-sharepoint-zero-days-at-pwn2own/)
   - **Details**: During Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint were exploited. These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should apply patches released by VMware and Microsoft as soon as they become available and monitor for any unusual activity.

2. **Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT**
   - **Source**: [DarkReading](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/turkish-apt-exploits-chat-app-zero-day-spy-iraqi-kurds)
   - **Details**: A zero-day vulnerability in a chat application was exploited by the Turkish APT group known as Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Affected Systems**: Chat applications used by targeted groups
   - **Mitigation**: Users should update their chat applications to the latest versions and implement network monitoring to detect suspicious activities.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Chrome Zero-Day**
   - **Source**: [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-tags-recently-patched-chrome-bug-as-actively-exploited-zero-day/)
   - **Details**: A high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser was actively exploited before being patched. The vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code.
   - **CVE ID**: Not specified
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome
   - **Mitigation**: Users should update Chrome to the latest version immediately and enable automatic updates to ensure timely patching.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Source**: [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-defendnot-tool-tricks-windows-into-disabling-microsoft-defender/)
   - **Details**: The 'Defendnot' tool tricks Windows into disabling Microsoft Defender by registering a fake antivirus product.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should enforce strict application whitelisting and monitor for unauthorized changes to security settings.

2. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Source**: [DarkReading](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dynamic-dns-cyberattack-facilitator)
   - **Details**: Threat actors are using dynamic DNS services to obfuscate their activities and impersonate well-known brands.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement DNS filtering and monitor for unusual DNS queries.

3. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Source**: [TheHackerNews](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fileless-remcos-rat-delivered-via-lnk.html)
   - **Details**: A new malware campaign uses LNK files and MSHTA to deliver the Remcos RAT in a fileless manner.
   - **Mitigation**: Disable MSHTA and LNK file execution where possible, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect fileless malware.

### Critical Vulnerabilities with High Impact

1. **Intel CPU Flaws**
   - **Source**: [TheHackerNews](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/researchers-expose-new-intel-cpu-flaws.html)
   - **Details**: New flaws in Intel CPUs enable memory leaks and Spectre v2 attacks, affecting all modern Intel CPUs.
   - **Mitigation**: Apply microcode updates from Intel and enable security features such as Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI).

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Marbled Dust/Sea Turtle**
   - Exploited a chat app zero-day to spy on Iraqi Kurds.

2. **Scattered Spider and Other Phishers**
   - Utilizing dynamic DNS services to facilitate cyberattacks.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

- **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Network Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive network monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- **Endpoint Security**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malware and unauthorized changes.
- **User Education**: Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls and least privilege principles to limit the impact of potential breaches.

This report highlights the importance of staying vigilant and proactive in cybersecurity practices to protect against evolving threats and vulnerabilities.
