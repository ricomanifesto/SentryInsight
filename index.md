## Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

1. **VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days**
   - **Source**: [Hackers exploit VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint zero-days at Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-vmware-esxi-microsoft-sharepoint-zero-days-at-pwn2own/)
   - **Details**: During Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint were exploited. These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should apply the latest patches provided by VMware and Microsoft as soon as they are available.

2. **Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT**
   - **Source**: [Turkish APT Exploits Chat App Zero-Day to Spy on Iraqi Kurds](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/turkish-apt-exploits-chat-app-zero-day-spy-iraqi-kurds)
   - **Details**: The threat actor known as Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle exploited a zero-day vulnerability in a chat application to spy on military targets.
   - **Affected Systems**: Specific chat application used by Iraqi Kurds
   - **Mitigation**: Users should update to the latest version of the chat application and apply any security patches released by the vendor.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Chrome Zero-Day**
   - **Source**: [CISA tags recently patched Chrome bug as actively exploited](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-tags-recently-patched-chrome-bug-as-actively-exploited-zero-day/)
   - **Details**: A high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser was actively exploited in the wild. CISA has urged federal agencies to secure their systems against this ongoing threat.
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome
   - **Mitigation**: Users should update to the latest version of Chrome immediately to protect against this vulnerability.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Source**: [New 'Defendnot' tool tricks Windows into disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-defendnot-tool-tricks-windows-into-disabling-microsoft-defender/)
   - **Details**: The 'Defendnot' tool registers a fake antivirus product to disable Microsoft Defender on Windows devices, even when no real AV is installed.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should monitor for unauthorized changes to antivirus settings and ensure that Microsoft Defender is properly configured and active.

2. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Source**: [Dynamic DNS Emerges as Go-to Cyberattack Facilitator](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dynamic-dns-cyberattack-facilitator)
   - **Details**: Threat actors are using dynamic DNS services to obfuscate their activities and impersonate well-known brands.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement DNS filtering and monitoring to detect and block suspicious dynamic DNS activity.

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Marbled Dust/Sea Turtle**
   - **Activity**: Exploited a chat app zero-day to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Mitigation**: Enhance monitoring and patch management for applications used in sensitive communications.

2. **Scattered Spider and Other Phishers**
   - **Activity**: Utilizing dynamic DNS to facilitate cyberattacks.
   - **Mitigation**: Strengthen email security and user awareness training to prevent phishing attacks.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

- **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems and applications are updated with the latest security patches, especially for known exploited vulnerabilities.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy robust endpoint protection solutions and regularly audit their configurations to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Network Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive network monitoring to detect unusual activities, such as the use of dynamic DNS services.
- **User Training**: Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users about phishing and social engineering tactics.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain a well-documented incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate security incidents.

By following these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation from known and emerging threats.
