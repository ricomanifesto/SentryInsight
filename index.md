# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco firewall systems are currently under active exploitation by nation-state threat actors, prompting emergency directives from CISA. Multiple zero-day flaws affecting Cisco ASA firewalls and IOS systems have been weaponized to deploy advanced malware including RayInitiator and LINE VIPER backdoors. Simultaneously, threat actors are exploiting vulnerabilities in network appliances, targeting cryptocurrency developers, and leveraging supply chain attacks through malicious packages in popular repositories. The exploitation landscape shows sophisticated campaigns ranging from Chinese APT groups deploying Brickstorm backdoors to North Korean actors targeting crypto developers with AkdoorTea malware.
