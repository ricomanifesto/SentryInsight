# Exploitation Report

Recent threat-intelligence disclosures highlight a surge in hands-on-keyboard intrusions that abuse configuration weaknesses rather than traditional software bugs. The most critical activity involves the Initial Access Broker **Gold Melody**, which is actively exploiting exposed ASP.NET machine-key material to forge authentication cookies and pivot deep inside enterprise networks. This approach grants full, persistent access without dropping obvious malware and is being monetized as turn-key access for downstream ransomware crews.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Exposed ASP.NET Machine-Key Abuse (Gold Melody Campaign)
- **Description**: ASP.NET applications rely on machine keys to sign and encrypt authentication cookies and ViewState data. If the private `validationKey` and `decryptionKey` are leaked (for example, through source-code leaks, mis-backups, or Git repositories), an attacker can generate fully trusted cookies, bypassing every built-in authentication control.
- **Impact**: Complete account impersonation; elevation to administrative roles; lateral movement into internal networks; ability to plant web-shells, exfiltrate data, and sell validated RDP/VPN credentials on dark-market forums.
- **Status**: Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation by Gold Melody IAB. No vendor patch (the weakness is a key-management error). Mitigation requires immediate key rotation, strict secrets-management, and invalidation of all active cookies.
- **CVE ID**: *Not referenced in the source material.*

## Affected Systems and Products
- **ASP.NET Web Applications**: Sites or portals running on .NET Framework 2.0–4.x that embed hard-coded machine keys or inadvertently publish them
  - **Platform**: Windows Server (IIS); cloud IaaS/PaaS instances hosting ASP.NET workloads
- **Internal Identity Services**: Custom SSO portals or legacy intranet apps that reuse the same machine keys across environments
  - **Platform**: On-premises Active Directory–integrated web tiers; hybrid cloud environments

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Forged Authentication Cookies**
  - **Vector**: Attacker acquires leaked `validationKey/decryptionKey`, crafts `.ASPXAUTH` cookies, and submits them to target applications to obtain privileged sessions.
- **Initial-Access Brokerage**
  - **Vector**: Compromised accounts and sessions are packaged and sold on underground markets, enabling ransomware and data-extortion follow-on attacks.
- **Stealth Persistence**
  - **Vector**: Abuse of legitimate web features (ViewState, Forms Authentication) eliminates the need for malware, reducing AV/EDR visibility.

## Threat Actor Activities
- **Actor/Group**: **Gold Melody (Initial Access Broker)**
  - **Campaign**: Weaponizes leaked ASP.NET machine keys against multiple enterprise targets in finance, manufacturing, and professional-services sectors. After achieving web-layer compromise, the group harvests additional credentials, establishes reverse proxies, then sells network footholds to ransomware affiliates. Evidence shows rapid turnover—access often sold within 24 hours of initial breach.
