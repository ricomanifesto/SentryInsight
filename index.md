# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting multiple high-value systems, with several zero-day vulnerabilities and actively exploited flaws demanding immediate attention. Adobe Experience Manager faces a perfect 10.0 CVSS score vulnerability that CISA has flagged as actively exploited, while Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 172-183 security holes including three zero-day vulnerabilities already under active exploitation in the wild. Nation-state actors have breached F5's systems, stealing undisclosed BIG-IP vulnerabilities and source code, while the Clop ransomware group exploited Oracle zero-day vulnerabilities to breach Harvard University. Industrial control systems face severe risks from Red Lion RTU vulnerabilities, and attackers are actively exploiting SAP NetWeaver and ICTBroadcast servers for remote access.
