# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are actively being exploited across multiple major platforms, with particularly severe activity targeting Cisco network infrastructure and managed file transfer systems. The most concerning developments include maximum severity exploits against Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT platform (CVE-2025-10035) and a coordinated campaign exploiting Cisco ASA firewall vulnerabilities that prompted an emergency CISA directive. Nation-state actors, particularly China-linked groups, are leveraging these vulnerabilities alongside sophisticated malware campaigns to compromise telecommunications networks, edge devices, and enterprise infrastructure.
