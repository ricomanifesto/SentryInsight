# Exploitation Report

A surge of highly opportunistic and targeted threat activity is exploiting weaknesses across firmware, cloud infrastructure, supply-chain ecosystems, and emerging AI platforms. The most critical developments include: prompt-injection attacks that abuse Google Gemini’s security UX, boot-level compromises of Gigabyte motherboards that bypass Secure Boot, widespread poisoning of the npm registry with North-Korean XORIndex malware, the state-sponsored “HazyBeacon” campaign that hides C2 traffic in AWS Lambda, and Interlock ransomware’s adoption of the new “FileFix” delivery path to weaponize web-injects and remote access trojans. Collectively, these exploits enable stealthy initial access, persistent control, and large-scale data exfiltration across government, enterprise, and consumer environments.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Default Credential Exposure in McDonald’s Hiring Platform
- **Description**: The cloud-hosted recruitment portal retained factory-set credentials, allowing unauthenticated access to backend databases containing 64 million applicant records.  
- **Impact**: Attackers can harvest PII at scale, stage credential-stuffing campaigns, and conduct identity fraud.  
- **Status**: Data was exposed in the wild; remediation steps and credential rotation are reportedly complete.  

### Prompt-Injection Flaw in Google Gemini
- **Description**: Gemini accepts invisible Unicode/formatting characters, letting adversaries craft malicious prompts that masquerade as legitimate Google Security alerts.  
- **Impact**: Facilitates phishing, privilege escalation within chat sessions, and potential lateral movement if users execute embedded instructions.  
- **Status**: Actively abused, Google is engineering mitigations; no comprehensive patch is yet rolled out.  

### UEFI Firmware Weaknesses in Gigabyte Motherboards
- **Description**: Multiple vulnerable UEFI modules permit unsigned code execution during the boot chain, enabling installation of stealth bootkits.  
- **Impact**: Attackers obtain pre-OS persistence, evade AV/EDR, and survive disk re-imaging.  
- **Status**: Exploits observed in the wild; Gigabyte is releasing firmware updates per board model.  

### XORIndex Supply-Chain Poisoning via Malicious npm Packages
- **Description**: North-Korean actors published 67 backdoored npm packages that sideload a new malware loader dubbed “XORIndex.”  
- **Impact**: Compromises developer workstations and any downstream applications compiled with the tainted packages.  
- **Status**: Packages have been removed, but clones and forks remain; active infections continue to surface.  

### “HazyBeacon” AWS Lambda Abuse
- **Description**: A novel Windows backdoor communicates exclusively through legitimate AWS cloud services, blending C2 and data-exfil traffic into normal Lambda API calls.  
- **Impact**: Enables covert espionage against Southeast-Asian government networks, bypassing perimeter controls that trust AWS domains.  
- **Status**: Campaign ongoing; no vendor patch (abuse of legitimate cloud-service functionality).  

### FileFix / ClickFix Exploit in Interlock Ransomware Operations
- **Description**: Attackers manipulate legitimate “FileFix” update logic to sideload a PHP-based Interlock RAT, later deploying full ransomware payloads.  
- **Impact**: Initial access, remote control, and eventual encryption of enterprise assets across multiple industries.  
- **Status**: Live campaigns with increasing adoption; mitigation requires application-layer validation and patching vulnerable update scripts.  

### Malformed-APK Evasion Used by Konfety Android Malware
- **Description**: Konfety distributes APKs with intentionally corrupted ZIP headers and layered obfuscation, fooling static and dynamic scanners.  
- **Impact**: Enables installation of spyware and banking trojans on Android devices with reduced detection rates.  
- **Status**: Samples circulating in third-party stores and phishing lures; Google Play Protect updates are rolling out heuristics to catch malformed archives.  

### Shadow-Git Repository Exposure
- **Description**: Publicly reachable Git repositories leak tokens, keys, and proprietary code due to misconfigurations and absent ACLs.  
- **Impact**: Immediate credential compromise, supply-chain attack surface expansion, and reconnaissance for further intrusions.  
- **Status**: Continuous exploitation observed; industry guidance stresses automated secrets scanning and repository hardening.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **FileFix/ClickFix Auto-Update Component**  
  - **Platform**: PHP and Windows environments leveraged by Interlock ransomware operators  

- **Android Devices (various vendors)**  
  - **Platform**: Android 11–15 targeted by Konfety’s malformed APKs  

- **Enterprise Git Repositories (self-hosted & cloud-based GitHub/GitLab)**  
  - **Platform**: Cross-platform development and CI/CD stacks  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Default Credential Abuse**  
  - **Vector**: Direct HTTPS access to misconfigured admin endpoints  

- **Prompt Injection**  
  - **Vector**: Invisible Unicode characters nested in chat prompts to override assistant logic  

- **UEFI Bootkit Deployment**  
  - **Vector**: Flashing malicious firmware modules or exploiting unsigned update processes  

- **Supply-Chain Package Poisoning**  
  - **Vector**: Installation of malicious npm packages during `npm install` workflows  

- **Cloud-Based C2 Tunneling**  
  - **Vector**: AWS Lambda function invocations and S3 traffic masquerading as normal service use  

- **FileFix Sideloading**  
  - **Vector**: Manipulated application-update URLs delivering PHP RAT payloads  

- **Malformed APK Delivery**  
  - **Vector**: Phishing SMS, third-party stores, or drive-by downloads serving structurally corrupted APKs  

- **Git Secrets Leakage**  
  - **Vector**: Unrestricted `.git` directories exposed over HTTP/S or misconfigured repository permissions  

## Threat Actor Activities
