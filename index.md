### 2. NodeSnake RAT by Interlock Ransomware Gang
- **Description**: The Interlock ransomware gang is deploying a new remote access trojan (RAT) named NodeSnake against educational institutions for persistent network access.
- **Affected Systems**: Corporate networks of educational institutions.
- **Attack Vector**: Undocumented RAT deployment.
- **Mitigation**: Enhance network monitoring, employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and conduct regular security awareness training.

### 3. AyySSHush Botnet
- **Description**: A botnet named AyySSHush has compromised over 9,000 ASUS routers, adding a persistent SSH backdoor. It also targets SOHO routers from Cisco, D-Link, and Linksys.
- **Affected Systems**: ASUS, Cisco, D-Link, and Linksys routers.
- **Attack Vector**: SSH backdoor installation.
- **Mitigation**: Update router firmware, disable remote management, and change default credentials.

### 4. CVE-2025-32432 in Craft CMS
- **Description**: The Mimo hackers are exploiting a remote code execution flaw in Craft CMS to deploy cryptominers and proxyware.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-32432
- **Affected Systems**: Craft CMS installations.
- **Attack Vector**: Remote code execution.
- **Mitigation**: Apply the latest security patches for Craft CMS and monitor for unusual activity.

### 5. Microsoft OneDrive File Picker Flaw
- **Description**: A security flaw in Microsoft's OneDrive File Picker allows websites to access a user's entire cloud storage content.
- **Affected Systems**: Microsoft OneDrive users.
- **Attack Vector**: Exploitation of file picker flaw.
- **Mitigation**: Limit app permissions and monitor for unauthorized access.

### 6. DragonForce Ransomware
- **Description**: DragonForce ransomware exploits vulnerabilities in the SimpleHelp remote monitoring and management platform to conduct supply chain attacks.
- **Affected Systems**: Managed Service Providers (MSPs) using SimpleHelp.
- **Attack Vector**: Exploitation of SimpleHelp vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation**: Patch SimpleHelp vulnerabilities, restrict access to RMM tools, and implement network segmentation.

### 7. Commvault SaaS Environment Attacks
- **Description**: Threat actors have gained access to Microsoft 365 environments of Commvault's Metallic service customers.
- **Affected Systems**: Microsoft 365 environments of Commvault customers.
- **Attack Vector**: Unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation**: Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conduct regular security audits.

### 8. Browser-in-the-Middle Attacks
- **Description**: These attacks steal user sessions by intercepting browser communications.
- **Affected Systems**: Web browsers.
- **Attack Vector**: Session hijacking.
- **Mitigation**: Use secure connections (HTTPS), implement session timeouts, and educate users on phishing risks.

## Notable Threat Actors

- **Interlock Ransomware Gang**: Deploying NodeSnake RAT against educational institutions.
- **Mimo Hackers**: Exploiting Craft CMS vulnerabilities.
- **DragonForce Ransomware Group**: Conducting supply chain attacks via SimpleHelp vulnerabilities.
- **APT31 (China-linked)**: Accused of targeting the Czech Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems to the latest versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
2. **Network Security**: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation to limit attack surfaces.
3. **Access Controls**: Use strong, unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
4. **User Education**: Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users about phishing, social engineering, and safe browsing practices.
5. **Monitoring and Response**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation by threat actors.
