# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats are dominated by sophisticated espionage campaigns, insider threats, and ransomware operations targeting critical infrastructure and healthcare organizations. Chinese state-sponsored groups including Murky Panda, Genesis, and Glacial Panda are actively exploiting cloud and telecommunications infrastructure through trusted relationship abuse. Meanwhile, insider threats continue to pose significant risks, as demonstrated by a former developer who deployed kill-switch malware against his previous employer. Ransomware groups remain highly active, with recent attacks against major healthcare provider DaVita affecting nearly 2.7 million individuals and telecommunications company Colt Technology Services experiencing data theft by the Warlock ransomware gang.
