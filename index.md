# Exploitation Report

The past week has been marked by coordinated exploitation of multiple high-impact enterprise-grade vulnerabilities. A previously unknown APT dubbed **NightEagle** is chaining a Microsoft Exchange zero-day to gain persistent, covert access to mail servers inside Chinese military-industrial networks, while financially motivated attackers continue to weaponize two already-patched Ivanti Connect Secure flaws to burrow into VPN gateways worldwide. Google rushed an emergency patch for a new Chrome zero-day that was being used in highly targeted drive-by attacks before public disclosure. Together, these exploits demonstrate a rapid shift from initial proof-of-concept to full operational use by both state-sponsored and criminal actors, underscoring the need for aggressive patch management and layered detection strategies.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft Exchange Server Zero-Day (NightEagle Campaign)
- **Description**: An undisclosed remote-code-execution flaw in on-premises Microsoft Exchange that allows unauthenticated attackers to drop web shells and execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges.  
- **Impact**: Full takeover of Exchange servers, lateral movement inside the network, email exfiltration, and persistent backdoor deployment.  
- **Status**: Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation by the NightEagle APT. No official patch released; mitigation guidance limited to disabling vulnerable endpoints and enhancing EDR visibility.

### Google Chrome Zero-Day Vulnerability
- **Description**: Memory-corruption bug in the browser’s graphics rendering pipeline leveraged for arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser.  
- **Impact**: Drive-by compromise enabling spyware installation or follow-on malware payloads after a user merely visits a malicious or compromised website.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited prior to disclosure. Google issued an out-of-band update (Stable 126.0.5189.110 and later) that closes the hole.

### Ivanti Connect Secure Authentication Bypass  
- **Description**: An authentication logic flaw that allows remote attackers to bypass login controls on Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure VPN appliances.  
- **Impact**: Unauthenticated access to internal VPN portals, session hijacking, and credential harvesting, often leading to deployment of remote web shells.  
- **Status**: Widely exploited in the wild by multiple ransomware and APT groups. Patch available; Ivanti urges immediate upgrade and certificate rotation.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2023-46805

### Ivanti Connect Secure Command Injection  
- **Description**: A command-injection vulnerability reachable through crafted API requests once the authentication bypass has been completed.  
- **Impact**: Direct execution of system commands with root privileges on the VPN appliance, enabling network pivoting and persistent implant installation.  
- **Status**: Actively chained with the authentication bypass above. Fixes released concurrently; exploitation continues against unpatched appliances.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-21887

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Exchange Server**: On-prem versions 2013, 2016, 2019 (all cumulative update levels prior to forthcoming patch)  
  - **Platform**: Windows Server deployments in government, defense, and technology sectors  

- **Google Chrome**: Versions prior to 126.0.5189.110 on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
  - **Platform**: Desktop and managed enterprise endpoints  

- **Ivanti Connect Secure & Policy Secure**: 9.x and 22.x firmware lines prior to the January and February security updates  
  - **Platform**: Purpose-built VPN/Zero-Trust gateways in corporate and MSP environments  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Web-Shell Implantation via Unknown Exchange Endpoint**  
  - **Vector**: Crafted HTTP requests exploiting the zero-day to upload ASPX web shells, followed by PowerShell command execution.  

- **Drive-By Browser Exploit**  
  - **Technique**: Malicious JavaScript triggers the Chrome rendering-engine bug, gaining code execution within the renderer and escaping the sandbox to drop payloads.  
  - **Vector**: Compromised legitimate websites and malvertising infrastructure.  

- **Chained VPN Exploit (Auth Bypass → Command Injection)**  
  - **Technique**: Automated tooling first exploits CVE-2023-46805 to obtain an authenticated session token, then sends a specially crafted API call exploiting CVE-2024-21887 to spawn a root shell.  
  - **Vector**: Direct Internet-facing access over HTTPS (TCP 443).  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **NightEagle (APT-Q-95)**  
  - **Campaign**: Targets Chinese military, aerospace, and semiconductor organizations. Uses the Exchange zero-day to exfiltrate mailbox contents and deploy custom persistence implants.  

- **Multiple Ransomware & Initial-Access Brokers**  
  - **Campaign**: Mass-scanning for unpatched Ivanti appliances; observed selling footholds to ransomware-as-a-service groups for post-exploitation.  

- **Unattributed Browser Exploit Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Highly targeted watering-hole attacks against media and civil-society organizations using the latest Chrome zero-day prior to Google’s patch release.  

These concurrent exploitation waves highlight attackers’ continued preference for edge-device vulnerabilities and widely deployed enterprise software that provide immediate privilege and visibility advantages once compromised.
