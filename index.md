# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security incidents involving insider threats, ransomware operations, and newly discovered vulnerability chains. Most notably, Commvault has disclosed four pre-authentication vulnerabilities that can be chained together to achieve remote code execution, representing a significant risk to enterprise backup infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Warlock ransomware group continues active operations against telecommunications providers, and the Scattered Spider collective faces legal consequences for their high-profile cyberattacks. Additionally, emerging attack vectors targeting AI systems and electric vehicle charging infrastructure highlight the expanding attack surface in modern technology environments.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Commvault Pre-Authentication Vulnerability Chain
- **Description**: Four security vulnerabilities in Commvault that can be chained together to achieve remote code execution without authentication
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable Commvault instances, potentially compromising entire backup infrastructure
- **Status**: Commvault has released security updates to address these vulnerabilities

### Insider Threat Kill Switch Malware
- **Description**: Custom malware deployed by a software developer containing a kill switch mechanism that locked out employees when the perpetrator's account was disabled
- **Impact**: Complete system lockout and disruption of business operations on Windows networks
- **Status**: Legal action completed with four-year prison sentence for the perpetrator

### ChatGPT Downgrade Attack
- **Description**: Attack technique using brief, plain prompts to force ChatGPT to query older, less secure models
