# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting multiple enterprise systems and platforms, with threat actors actively exploiting vulnerabilities in Ivanti EPMM solutions and Google Chrome browsers. CISA has issued warnings about malware strains specifically targeting Ivanti endpoint management systems, while Google has patched its sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability of the year that was being actively exploited in attacks. Additionally, significant breaches have impacted SonicWall's cloud backup services and enterprise systems, with threat actors deploying sophisticated malware campaigns including SystemBC proxy botnets, supply chain attacks targeting Python developers, and targeted espionage operations against U.S. government entities.
