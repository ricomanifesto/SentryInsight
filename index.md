# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently under active exploitation across enterprise systems, with attackers targeting SAP S/4HANA environments and Sitecore content management platforms. The most severe threat involves CVE-2025-42957 affecting SAP S/4HANA systems, which requires minimal effort to exploit and can result in complete system compromise including the underlying host operating system. Additionally, a critical Sitecore vulnerability has prompted CISA to issue emergency patching orders for federal agencies, indicating widespread exploitation attempts. These attacks demonstrate sophisticated threat actors' focus on high-value enterprise targets that can provide extensive network access and sensitive data exposure.
