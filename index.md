# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently being observed across multiple attack vectors, with ransomware groups actively targeting infrastructure vulnerabilities and new attack techniques emerging. The Akira ransomware group is actively exploiting CVE-2024-40766, a critical access control vulnerability in SonicWall SSL VPN devices that enables unauthorized access to corporate networks. Additionally, researchers have identified VMScape, a new Spectre-like attack that breaks guest-host isolation on modern AMD and Intel CPUs, potentially exposing cryptographic keys from hypervisor processes. The threat landscape also shows the resurgence of the Vidar infostealer with enhanced evasion capabilities, while Russian APT groups are conducting targeted attacks against critical infrastructure in Kazakhstan.
