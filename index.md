# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being exploited or pose immediate security risks. The most significant threat is a maximum-severity remote code execution vulnerability in Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) RADIUS subsystem, which has received a CVSS score of 10.0. Additionally, Plex has urgently notified users to patch a recently discovered security vulnerability in their media servers. Nation-state actors, particularly those attributed to Russia, continue targeting critical infrastructure including water and wastewater systems in Norway and Poland. The cybersecurity landscape also shows concerning developments in authentication bypass techniques, with researchers demonstrating downgrade attacks that can circumvent FIDO security protocols.
