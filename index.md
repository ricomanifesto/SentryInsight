# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats reveal a concerning landscape of active exploitation targeting multiple platforms and systems. Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being leveraged in sophisticated attacks against targeted individuals, while state-sponsored groups continue to exploit cloud trust relationships for supply chain compromises. Notable activities include Chinese APT groups exploiting cloud environments to access downstream customers, Pakistani threat actors using novel Linux attack vectors, and the emergence of new malware families targeting both Windows and macOS systems. Additionally, hardware vulnerabilities in widely-deployed Dell laptops have exposed millions of devices to potential firmware-level compromise.
