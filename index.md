# Exploitation Report

Ongoing threat activity this week is dominated by two confirmed, in-the-wild exploits: a critical remote-code-execution flaw in the popular WordPress “Alone” theme and a high-severity Web-browser vulnerability that Apple has now patched after it was leveraged in recent Chrome zero-day attacks. Both issues enable full compromise of targeted systems with minimal user interaction and have already been weaponized by multiple threat actors for site takeovers, data theft, and potential follow-on malware deployment.

## Active Exploitation Details

### WordPress “Alone” Theme – Unauthenticated File Upload RCE
- **Description**: The theme’s upload handler fails to properly validate user-supplied files, allowing unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to the web root. Successful uploads give the adversary the ability to execute commands with the web-server’s privileges.  
- **Impact**: Full site takeover, web-shell installation, credential dumping, defacement, and lateral movement into underlying infrastructure.  
- **Status**: Confirmed mass exploitation in the wild. The theme developer has released an updated version that removes the vulnerable upload endpoint. Administrators must patch or disable the theme immediately.  

### Apple Web-Browser (WebRTC) Memory Corruption Vulnerability
- **Description**: A memory-handling flaw in the WebRTC component of Apple’s browser stack can be triggered by specially crafted web content. The same bug was used as a Chrome zero-day before being ported to attack Safari-based targets.  
- **Impact**: Remote attackers can gain arbitrary code execution on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices, potentially leading to device takeover, spyware installation, and data exfiltration.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild. Apple has rolled out security updates for the latest releases of macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and Safari. Users must update immediately.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **WordPress Alone Theme**: All versions prior to the fixed release (as reported in the vendor’s advisory).  
  - **Platform**: WordPress CMS installations on Linux or Windows hosting environments.  

- **Safari / WebKit (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)**: Pre-patch versions shipped with current production builds before Apple’s out-of-band security update.  
  - **Platform**: macOS desktops/laptops, iPhones, and iPads running the vulnerable WebKit build.  

- **Chromium-based Browsers**: Earlier Chrome versions impacted by the same WebRTC flaw prior to Google’s emergency patch.  
  - **Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android operating the affected Chrome releases.  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Unauthenticated File Upload via Theme Endpoint**  
  - **Vector**: Direct HTTP POST requests to the theme’s upload handler, bypassing authentication controls and placing a PHP web shell on the server.  

- **Malicious Web Content Exploiting WebRTC**  
  - **Vector**: Drive-by web pages or malvertising that deliver crafted media streams to trigger the WebRTC memory corruption, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the browser context.  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unknown Mass-Exploitation Clusters**  
  - **Campaign**: Automated scanning and exploitation of WordPress sites running the “Alone” theme, followed by web-shell deployment and use of the compromised servers for spam, phishing kits, and further malware hosting.  

- **Unattributed Zero-Day Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Leveraged the WebRTC flaw against Chrome users and, subsequently, Safari users to install spyware and collect sensitive data before vendor patches became available.  

- **ShinyHunters**  
  - **Campaign**: Voice-phishing attacks to steal Salesforce authentication tokens, enabling large-scale data theft at Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and other high-profile organizations.  

- **Silk Typhoon (China-linked APT)**  
  - **Campaign**: Continued development of proprietary offensive tooling and exploitation of public-facing applications as part of contractor ecosystems supporting PRC objectives.  

- **UNC2891 / LightBasin**  
  - **Campaign**: Planted 4G-enabled Raspberry Pi devices inside a bank’s network in an attempted ATM jackpotting operation, highlighting sophisticated physical intrusion coupled with network exploitation.
