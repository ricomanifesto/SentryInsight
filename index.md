# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals a concerning shift toward AI-powered attacks and sophisticated cloud-based exploitation campaigns. Multiple threat actors are leveraging artificial intelligence to automate reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and data encryption operations. Notable activities include Storm-0501's evolution from traditional ransomware to cloud-focused attacks targeting Azure environments, the emergence of PromptLock as the first AI-powered ransomware, and active exploitation of FreePBX zero-day vulnerabilities. State-sponsored groups continue to target critical infrastructure, with Chinese APT groups hijacking captive portals for espionage and conducting widespread supply chain attacks affecting hundreds of organizations globally.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FreePBX Zero-Day Vulnerability
