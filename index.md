# Exploitation Report

During the past week, defenders have had to react quickly to a surge of in-the-wild exploitation targeting critical remote-code-execution and authentication-bypass flaws across enterprise infrastructure, developer tooling, and consumer devices. The most urgent activity centers on ongoing attacks against Citrix NetScaler appliances (Citrix Bleed 2), Wing FTP Server, and Fortinet FortiWeb, all of which now have public proof-of-concept exploits and wide-scale scanning. At the same time, an Iranian-aligned Pay2Key ransomware resurgence, the compromise of WordPress Gravity Forms installers, and a novel “GPUHammer” RowHammer technique against NVIDIA GPUs expand the threat landscape. Immediate patching, key rotation, and supply-chain hygiene are essential.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Citrix Bleed 2 – NetScaler ADC & Gateway Information Disclosure / Session Hijack  
- **Description**: A critical flaw in Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway that allows unauthenticated attackers to harvest session tokens directly from appliance memory, enabling full hijack of active VPN sessions.  
- **Impact**: Remote takeover of user sessions, lateral movement inside corporate networks, potential deployment of ransomware or data exfiltration.  
- **Status**: Confirmed active exploitation; CISA added the flaw to the KEV catalog and mandated federal patching. Fixes are available from Citrix.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-5777  

### Wing FTP Server Remote Code Execution  
- **Description**: A maximum-severity RCE in Wing FTP Server triggered via crafted HTTP requests that abuse insufficient input validation in the server’s admin functionality.  
- **Impact**: Full system compromise, arbitrary command execution, file manipulation, and establishment of persistence on Windows and Linux servers.  
- **Status**: Exploitation observed less than 24 hours after technical details were published. Vendor patches released; upgrading is mandatory.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-47812  

### Fortinet FortiWeb Pre-Auth SQL Injection to RCE  
- **Description**: A pre-authentication SQL injection in FortiWeb’s web interface enabling attackers to run arbitrary database commands that cascade into remote code execution.  
- **Impact**: Complete device takeover, credential theft, and use of the appliance as an internal pivot point.  
- **Status**: Multiple proof-of-concept exploits in the wild; security researchers report active scanning. Fortinet has issued patched firmware.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-25257  

### GPUHammer RowHammer Variant on NVIDIA GDDR6 GPUs  
- **Description**: A newly disclosed RowHammer technique that repeatedly flips bits in GDDR6 memory, corrupting model parameters and silently degrading AI inferencing on NVIDIA GPUs when ECC is disabled.  
- **Impact**: Integrity violations of AI workloads, potential model poisoning, denial-of-service, and misinformation risks in AI outputs.  
- **Status**: Demonstrated by academics; no hardware patch possible. NVIDIA advises enabling system-level ECC and firmware mitigations.  

### Laravel APP_KEY Leakage Leading to Remote Code Execution  
- **Description**: Attackers weaponize publicly exposed Laravel APP_KEY secrets (often found in misconfigured GitHub repositories) to derive encryption keys and craft malicious deserialization payloads.  
- **Impact**: Remote execution of arbitrary PHP code in over 600 identified production applications, data theft, and takeover of cloud resources.  
- **Status**: Active mass scanning and exploitation; remediation requires rotating APP_KEY, re-encrypting data, and removing leaked secrets.  

### Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor  
- **Description**: The legitimate WordPress Gravity Forms website was breached, and manual installer ZIPs were replaced with a PHP backdoor that phones home for commands.  
- **Impact**: Compromise of every site that manually downloaded and installed the tainted package; enables privilege escalation and site defacement.  
- **Status**: Ongoing investigation; clean installers now available. Affected sites must reinstall and audit for secondary payloads.  

### PerfektBlue – OpenSynergy BlueSDK One-Click Bluetooth RCE  
- **Description**: A chain of four vulnerabilities in the BlueSDK Bluetooth stack that allow attackers within wireless range to send a single malicious packet and execute code on infotainment systems and embedded devices.  
- **Impact**: Remote hijack of vehicle ECUs, industrial controllers, and billions of consumer devices, enabling tracking, microphone activation, or sabotage.  
- **Status**: No confirmed exploitation yet, but PoCs are functional. Patches are awaiting distribution from multiple OEMs.  

### OpenVSX Extension Supply-Chain Zero-Day  
- **Description**: A now-patched flaw in Eclipse’s OpenVSX registry that let attackers take over any extension namespace, push malicious VS Code add-ons, and compromise developer machines.  
- **Impact**: Full developer workstation compromise, credential theft, CI/CD poisoning, downstream supply-chain attacks.  
- **Status**: Patched; no evidence of mass exploitation before disclosure, but risk window existed for all “Cursor” and “Windsurf” users.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Pre-Auth SQL Injection to RCE**  
  - **Vector**: Crafted HTTP request to `/api/v2.0/` on FortiWeb causes unsanitized SQL query execution.  
- **Session Token Memory Scrape (Citrix Bleed 2)**  
  - **Vector**: Unauthenticated TLS request that returns memory fragments containing valid session cookies.  
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation (Wing FTP)**  
  - **Vector**: Malformed administrative request exploiting buffer overflow to spawn a system shell.  
- **RowHammer Bit-Flip (GPUHammer)**  
  - **Vector**: Repeated memory row activation on GDDR6 to induce deterministic bit errors.  
- **Leaked Secret Abuse (Laravel)**  
  - **Vector**: Use exposed APP_KEY to sign malicious serialized objects posted to `/login` or other endpoints.  
- **Supply-Chain Trojan (Gravity Forms)**  
  - **Vector**: Users manually install compromised ZIP, which autoloads a backdoor during plugin activation.  
- **One-Click Bluetooth RCE (PerfektBlue)**  
  - **Vector**: Single malicious L2CAP packet exploiting heap corruption in BlueSDK.  
- **Namespace Takeover (OpenVSX)**  
  - **Vector**: Race condition in namespace registration allowed attacker to publish higher-version extension overriding originals.

- **Academic Researchers (GPUHammer)**  
  - **Campaign**: Demonstration attack to highlight weaknesses in GPU memory protection; no malicious activity observed.  
- **OpenSynergy PerfektBlue Disclosure Team**

**Bold remediation priority:** patch Citrix NetScaler (CVE-2025-5777), Wing FTP (CVE-2025-47812), and FortiWeb (CVE-2025-25257) immediately, enable ECC on NVIDIA GPUs, rotate Laravel APP_KEYs, and verify WordPress plugin integrity to curb ongoing exploitation.
