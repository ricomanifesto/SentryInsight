# Exploitation Report

Current threat intelligence reveals several critical exploitation activities across multiple attack vectors. A significant surge in coordinated scanning activity is targeting Microsoft RDP authentication servers, with nearly 2,000 IP addresses conducting reconnaissance operations. Meanwhile, threat actors are leveraging sophisticated AI-based attacks to steal user data through malicious prompts hidden in downscaled images processed by AI systems. Critical vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, including a dangerous security flaw in Apple devices that may have already been exploited in sophisticated targeted attacks, and a critical Docker container escape vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.3. Additionally, multiple data breaches have impacted millions of users, including attacks on Salesforce infrastructure affecting major insurance providers, and widespread malware distribution through Google Play Store applications.
