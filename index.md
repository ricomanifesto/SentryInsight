# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape reveals intense exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors, with notable zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in critical infrastructure. Cisco has confirmed active exploitation of a high-severity SNMP vulnerability in IOS and IOS XE Software that allows remote code execution or denial-of-service attacks. Meanwhile, CISA reported that attackers successfully breached a federal agency by exploiting CVE-2024-36401, a critical GeoServer vulnerability, demonstrating the rapid weaponization of disclosed flaws. The threat environment is further complicated by sophisticated supply chain attacks, including malicious Rust crates targeting cryptocurrency wallets, and persistent campaigns by state-sponsored actors like North Korean groups deploying new backdoors such as AkdoorTea against cryptocurrency developers.
