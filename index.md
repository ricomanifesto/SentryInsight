# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. Russian threat actors are actively exploiting a 7-year-old Cisco vulnerability to breach thousands of end-of-life devices in campaigns targeting enterprises and critical infrastructure. Apple has released emergency patches for a new zero-day vulnerability that was exploited in extremely sophisticated targeted attacks. Additionally, cybercriminals are increasingly abusing AI-powered website builders like Lovable to create phishing pages and malware distribution sites, while password manager browser extensions face DOM-based clickjacking vulnerabilities that could lead to credential theft.
