# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently dominated by several critical zero-day exploitations and sophisticated ransomware campaigns targeting enterprise systems. Most notably, the Clop ransomware gang has been actively exploiting a critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) since early August, affecting a wide range of Oracle customers. Simultaneously, the Storm-1175 threat group has been leveraging a maximum severity vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035) to deploy Medusa ransomware. Additional zero-day activity includes exploitation of Zimbra email systems and a 13-year-old Redis vulnerability with a perfect CVSS score of 10.0. These attacks are complemented by large-scale extortion campaigns, with ShinyHunters conducting massive data theft operations affecting multiple major corporations including Salesforce customers and Red Hat.
