## Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

1. **VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days**
   - **Event**: Exploited at Pwn2Own Berlin 2025.
   - **Impact**: Successful exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint.
   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint.
   - **Mitigation**: Immediate patching and monitoring for unusual activity.

2. **Chat App Zero-Day**
   - **Event**: Exploited by Turkish APT group Marbled Dust (Sea Turtle) to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Impact**: Continued espionage activities even after the zero-day became an n-day.
   - **Affected Systems**: Output Messenger.
   - **Mitigation**: Patch the application and monitor for suspicious communications.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Chrome Zero-Day**
   - **CVE ID**: Not specified.
   - **Event**: Tagged by CISA as actively exploited.
   - **Impact**: High-severity vulnerability in Chrome being exploited in the wild.
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome.
   - **Mitigation**: Update Chrome to the latest version immediately.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Event**: Used by groups like Scattered Spider to obfuscate activities and impersonate brands.
   - **Impact**: Enhanced phishing and hacking capabilities.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement DNS filtering and monitor for unusual DNS queries.

2. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Event**: PowerShell-based attacks delivering Remcos RAT.
   - **Impact**: Stealthy deployment of remote access trojans.
   - **Mitigation**: Disable MSHTA and LNK file execution where possible, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

3. **Skitnet Post-Exploitation Malware**
   - **Event**: Used by ransomware gangs for stealthy post-exploitation activities.
   - **Impact**: Increased difficulty in detecting and responding to ransomware attacks.
   - **Mitigation**: Strengthen network segmentation and employ behavioral analysis tools.

### Critical Vulnerabilities with High Impact

   - **Event**: New flaws discovered impacting all modern Intel CPUs.
   - **Impact**: Potential for sensitive data leaks from memory.
   - **Mitigation**: Apply microcode updates and enable mitigations for Spectre v2.

2. **Government Webmail Hacked via XSS Bugs**
   - **Event**: Global spy campaign 'RoundPress' exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact**: Theft of emails from high-value government organizations.
   - **Mitigation**: Patch webmail servers and implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Notable Threat Actors

1. **Marbled Dust (Sea Turtle)**
   - **Activity**: Exploiting chat app zero-day for espionage.
   - **Targets**: Military and government entities.

2. **Scattered Spider**
   - **Activity**: Using dynamic DNS for phishing and hacking.
   - **Targets**: Various organizations through brand impersonation.

## Recommendations for Mitigation
