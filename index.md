# Exploitation Report

Current security intelligence reveals a complex landscape of active exploitation targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Notable activities include sophisticated attacks on Milesight industrial cellular routers being exploited for SMS-based phishing campaigns across Europe since February 2022, and a new VMware vulnerability that has been actively exploited by Chinese threat actors for nearly a year. The emergence of advanced Android banking malware like Klopatra demonstrates the evolution of mobile threats, while supply chain attacks continue to impact organizations through software providers. Several high-severity vulnerabilities in enterprise solutions including OneLogin IAM systems and Red Hat OpenShift AI expose organizations to complete infrastructure takeover. Nation-state actors are employing increasingly sophisticated techniques, including memory-based attacks against Intel SGX security guarantees and persistent backdoor operations in targeted environments.
