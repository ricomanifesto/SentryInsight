# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity landscape reveals a surge in sophisticated attack campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Multiple threat actors are actively exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used platforms including Fortra GoAnywhere MFT, Ivanti EPMM, and OpenAI's ChatGPT systems. Notably, a maximum severity command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) in Fortra's file transfer solution poses immediate risk to organizations with internet-exposed systems, while active exploitation of Ivanti endpoint management vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) has led to deployment of multiple malware strains in enterprise environments. Advanced persistent threat groups, particularly Iranian state-sponsored actors, are conducting highly targeted campaigns against telecommunications and satellite companies using sophisticated social engineering and custom malware toolkits.
