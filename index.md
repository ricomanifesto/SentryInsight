# Exploitation Report

Critical security vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in the wild, with Fortinet's FortiSIEM platform facing immediate threats through CVE-2025-25256, a critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8. Microsoft's August 2025 Patch Tuesday addressed a massive security update covering 111 vulnerabilities, including a publicly disclosed Kerberos zero-day vulnerability that poses significant risks to enterprise environments. Additionally, threat actors are deploying sophisticated ransomware campaigns, with the newly discovered Charon ransomware targeting Middle Eastern public sector and aviation industries using advanced APT-level evasion tactics. The exploitation landscape also includes ongoing Salesforce-related attacks that have resulted in significant data breaches affecting major insurance companies.
