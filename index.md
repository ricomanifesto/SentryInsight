# Exploitation Report

Recent security news highlights multiple vulnerabilities and exploits targeting popular enterprise products, mobile platforms, webmail software, and widely used hardware. Some of these issues are confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild (including at least one new Chrome zero-day), while others have been released with public exploit code. Notably, Cisco disclosed three ISE/CCP flaws with public exploit code, Qualcomm patched three previously exploited vulnerabilities, Roundcube fixed a critical 10-year-old bug allowing code execution, HPE issued fixes for StoreOnce authentication bypass flaws, and Google released an emergency out-of-band Chrome update to address an actively exploited zero-day. Unfortunately, none of the articles provided explicit CVE IDs for these flaws, but they are severe enough that administrators should investigate further and apply available patches immediately.

## Active Exploitation Details

• Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) Flaws  
  – Three vulnerabilities with public exploit code.  
  – Actively discussed in exploit forums.  
  – Allows attackers to potentially gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code.

• Qualcomm Security Flaws  
  – Three vulnerabilities patched in Qualcomm chipsets, confirmed to be exploited in the wild.  
  – Exploits may allow attackers to compromise devices at the hardware/firmware level.  
  – Requires OEMs to deploy additional fixes to finished products, so many end-users remain at risk.

• Roundcube Webmail Critical Bug  
  – A 10-year-old vulnerability that allows authenticated users to run malicious code on Roundcube servers.  
  – Exploited by attackers with access to compromised or stolen credentials.  
  – Patches have been released to address the flaw, which had gone unnoticed for a decade.

• HPE StoreOnce Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities  
  – Eight newly patched security issues in HPE StoreOnce data backup/deduplication solutions.  
  – One or more vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to bypass authentication and potentially gain control of the system.  
  – Publicly disclosed; administrators are urged to patch quickly due to the potential for remote compromise.

• New Google Chrome Zero-Day  
  – High-severity vulnerability under active exploitation.  
  – Google released an emergency out-of-band patch to address it.  
  – Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges via manipulated websites.

## Affected Systems and Products

• Cisco: Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP)  
• Qualcomm-based devices: Smartphones or other hardware using unpatched Qualcomm chipsets  
• Roundcube Webmail: Deployments running vulnerable versions over the past 10 years  
• HPE StoreOnce: Data backup and deduplication solutions  
• Google Chrome: All desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and potentially mobile versions until patched

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

• Public Exploit Code: The Cisco ISE/CCP flaws already have public code available, meaning threat actors can rapidly incorporate it into automated attacks or exploit frameworks.  
• Zero-Day/Unpatched Exploits: Attackers leverage the new unpatched or recently discovered vulnerabilities (Chrome zero-day, Qualcomm flaws) to gain remote code execution or escalate privileges.  
• Authentication Bypass: Several vulnerabilities (HPE StoreOnce, Roundcube) hinge on bypassing or subverting authentication mechanisms, allowing deeper compromise once an attacker obtains low-level access.  
• Credential Abuse: Exploits against Roundcube can be combined with stolen credentials for full server compromise.

## Threat Actor Activities

• Ransomware Gangs: Play ransomware’s broad reach (over 900 organizations) represents ongoing threat actor interest in big-game hunting, although no specific exploitation of the newly disclosed vulnerabilities was explicitly mentioned.  
• Crypto-Miners and Botnets: Threats against Asus routers, malicious supply chain packages in PyPI/npm/Ruby, and the Crocodilus Android banking trojan all underscore that attackers continue to diversify to build illicit botnets or siphon financial data.  
• State-Affiliated Hacking and Espionage: Incidents like the alleged Ukrainian hack on Tupolev highlight strategic cyber operations, although no direct linkage to zero-days or new CVEs was disclosed.  
• Cybercriminal Groups Targeting Cloud and SaaS: Threat actors exploit newly disclosed or insufficiently patched flaws in enterprise software (e.g., Cisco ISE, Salesforce vishing attacks, Roundcube webmail) to exfiltrate data or conduct fraud.  

Given the public availability of exploit code for some vulnerabilities and confirmed active use of others (especially the Chrome zero-day and Qualcomm chipset flaws), organizations should prioritize prompt patching. Maintaining strict monitoring, network segmentation, and layered defenses remains critical for mitigating these attacks.
