# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently under active exploitation, with CISA issuing emergency directives for immediate patching. The most severe threats include a critical SAP S/4HANA vulnerability (CVE-2025-42957) that allows complete system compromise with minimal effort, and a Sitecore vulnerability that has prompted federal agencies to patch by September 25, 2025. Additionally, a maximum severity Argo CD API flaw is exposing repository credentials, while threat actors are leveraging new malware-as-a-service operations and novel attack vectors through AI platforms.

## Active Exploitation Details
