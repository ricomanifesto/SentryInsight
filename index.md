# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple platforms, with particularly severe impacts on network infrastructure and managed file transfer systems. The most concerning activity involves a maximum severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT that allows remote command injection without authentication, which has been exploited in the wild for at least a week before public disclosure. Additionally, Cisco's network infrastructure faces multiple zero-day exploits targeting ASA firewalls and other devices, with threat actors deploying sophisticated malware including RayInitiator and LINE VIPER. The threat landscape is further complicated by AI-driven attacks, supply chain compromises, and ransomware operations that are successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication protections.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Fortra GoAnywhere MFT Command Injection
- **Description**: A maximum severity vulnerability allowing remote command injection without authentication in Fortra's GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer software
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise with ability to execute arbitrary commands remotely
- **Status**: Actively exploited as zero-day for approximately one week before public disclosure, patches now available
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-10035

### Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Multiple security flaws affecting the VPN web server of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software
- **Impact**: Complete device compromise enabling deployment of advanced persistent malware including RayInitiator and LINE VIPER backdoors
- **Status**: Actively exploited by nation-state actors, CISA has issued Emergency Mitigation Directive requiring immediate patching

### Cisco Network Infrastructure Zero-Days
- **Description**: Four actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities affecting millions of Cisco devices including firewalls and IOS systems
- **Impact**: Full device control, backdoor installation, and network persistence for espionage operations
- **Status**: Under active exploitation by nation-state actors, particularly the group behind the "ArcaneDoor" campaign

### SonicWall SSL VPN MFA Bypass
- **Description**: Vulnerability allowing Akira ransomware operators to bypass multi-factor authentication on SonicWall SSL VPN accounts
- **Impact**: Complete network access despite MFA protections, leading to ransomware deployment and data encryption
- **Status**: Ongoing active exploitation by Akira ransomware group
