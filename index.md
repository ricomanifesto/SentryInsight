# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting diverse platforms and systems. Most notably, Apple has patched a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) that was actively exploited in sophisticated attacks against targeted individuals, potentially indicating nation-state or spyware operations. Chinese state-sponsored group Murky Panda (Silk Typhoon) continues exploiting cloud trust relationships to compromise downstream customers in North America. Additionally, multiple threat actors are leveraging GeoServer vulnerabilities, Redis server exposures, and novel attack vectors including Linux .desktop file abuse by APT36, while new malware families like Shamos target Mac users through fake troubleshooting guides.
