# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerability exploitation activity continues to escalate across multiple fronts, with Google patching the sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability of the year (CVE-2025-10585) being actively exploited in attacks. CISA has issued warnings about two malware strains exploiting recently discovered vulnerabilities in Ivanti Enterprise Patch Management Mobile solutions (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428). Additionally, threat actors are leveraging sophisticated attack vectors including AI-generated scripts, compromised OAuth tokens to steal massive datasets, and collaborative operations between state-sponsored groups targeting Ukrainian infrastructure.
