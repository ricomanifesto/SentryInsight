# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently under active exploitation. The most significant threats include a maximum-severity RADIUS authentication flaw in Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center with a CVSS score of 10.0 that enables remote code execution, critical N-able vulnerabilities being actively exploited for local code execution and command injection, a Plex media server security vulnerability requiring immediate patching, and sophisticated phishing attacks bypassing FIDO authentication through downgrade techniques. Additionally, threat actors continue to leverage cryptocurrency exchanges for ransomware operations, with over $300 million in cybercrime-linked cryptocurrency recently seized by law enforcement.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center RADIUS Vulnerability
- **Description**: A maximum-severity security flaw in Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software affecting RADIUS authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on affected systems
- **Status**: Security updates have been released by Cisco; immediate patching required
- **CVE ID**: CVSS score of 10.0 (maximum severity)

### N-able Critical Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Two critical vulnerabilities in N-able systems that require authentication to exploit
- **Impact**: Enable local code execution and command injection capabilities for authenticated attackers
- **Status**: Under active exploitation according to CISA warnings; patches available and deployment urgent

### Plex Media Server Security Vulnerability
- **Description**: A recently patched security vulnerability in Plex media server software
- **Impact**: Specific impact details not disclosed, but Plex has issued urgent update notifications
- **Status**: Patches available; users notified to update immediately

### FIDO Authentication Bypass
- **Description**: Sophisticated phishing kits utilizing downgrade attacks to circumvent FIDO authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Allows threat actors to bypass multi-factor authentication protections
- **Status**: Active exploitation technique being used in phishing campaigns

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software**: All versions affected by the RADIUS authentication vulnerability
- **N-able Systems**: Multiple N-able products containing the critical vulnerabilities under active attack
