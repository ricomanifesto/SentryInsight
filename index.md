# Exploitation Report

Several critical exploitation activities are currently threatening enterprise environments, with the most significant being a Chrome zero-day vulnerability actively exploited in the wild. Google has patched CVE-2025-10585, a type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine that poses threats to millions of users. Additionally, threat actors have compromised SonicWall's MySonicWall service, exposing firewall configuration backup files for a subset of customers. The SystemBC proxy botnet continues to exploit vulnerable commercial VPS systems to maintain extensive proxy networks, while various threat actors are leveraging sophisticated social engineering techniques and malicious packages to deploy remote access trojans and credential theft tools.
