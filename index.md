# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity landscape shows significant active exploitation across multiple critical vulnerabilities, with several high-impact zero-day attacks targeting enterprise systems. The Clop ransomware gang has been actively exploiting a critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-61882) since early August for data theft operations. Additionally, Storm-1175 threat actors are exploiting a maximum severity Fortra GoAnywhere vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) to deploy Medusa ransomware. A 13-year-old Redis vulnerability with a perfect CVSS score of 10.0 poses significant risks to cloud infrastructure, while threat actors are also leveraging Zimbra zero-day vulnerabilities through sophisticated social engineering campaigns.
