# Exploitation Report

Over the last week, threat hunters observed a sharp rise in remote-code-execution and supply-chain intrusions targeting widely-used infrastructure and consumer technology. Active exploitation is confirmed for Wing FTP Server (CVE-2025-47812), Citrix NetScaler “CitrixBleed 2” (CVE-2025-5777), and Fortinet FortiWeb (CVE-2025-25257), while proof-of-concept code and real-world demonstrations show attackers abusing GPU memory (GPUHammer), Bluetooth stacks in 350 million cars (PerfektBlue), leaked Laravel APP_KEYs, and a compromised Gravity Forms distribution channel. Concurrently, the Pay2Key ransomware service is incentivizing affiliates, increasing the likelihood that these vulnerabilities will be folded into multi-stage extortion campaigns against U.S. and Israeli targets.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Wing FTP Server Remote Code Execution
- **Description**: A critical flaw in Wing FTP Server allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.  
- **Impact**: Complete server takeover, lateral movement, data theft, and potential ransomware deployment.  
- **Status**: Exploited in the wild within 24 hours of public disclosure; vendor patch available.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-47812  

### Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway “CitrixBleed 2”
- **Description**: Memory-handling error in NetScaler ADC and Gateway leads to sensitive information disclosure including session tokens.  
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, credential theft, potential pivot to internal resources.  
- **Status**: Added to CISA KEV after confirmed exploitation; hotfixes released by Citrix.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-5777  

### Fortinet FortiWeb Pre-Auth SQL Injection to RCE
- **Description**: Pre-authentication SQL injection in FortiWeb’s management interface enabling arbitrary database commands and remote code execution.  
- **Impact**: Full appliance compromise, malicious web-shell deployment, and traffic interception.  
- **Status**: Proof-of-concept exploits public; active scanning reported; patches published by Fortinet.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-25257  

### GPUHammer RowHammer Variant on NVIDIA GPUs
- **Description**: Adaptation of the classic RowHammer bit-flip attack targeting GDDR6 memory on NVIDIA GPUs.  
- **Impact**: Silent corruption of AI model parameters causing accuracy degradation or malicious model behavior.  
- **Status**: Demonstrated by researchers; NVIDIA urges enabling system-level ECC; no firmware patch yet.  

### Laravel APP_KEY Leakage Leads to Remote Code Execution
- **Description**: Exposed APP_KEY secrets on GitHub allow attackers to forge encrypted cookies and trigger PHP deserialization attacks.  
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on ≥600 Laravel applications, data exfiltration, privilege escalation.  
- **Status**: Actively weaponized against live sites; remediation requires key rotation and secret hygiene.  

### PerfektBlue Bluetooth Stack Vulnerabilities (OpenSynergy BlueSDK)
- **Description**: Four flaws in BlueSDK enable a 1-click attack chain that bypasses Bluetooth security profiles.  
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on in-vehicle infotainment systems and IoT devices, enabling surveillance or unsafe vehicle manipulation.  
- **Status**: Exploit code demonstrated; patches provided by OEMs pending wide deployment.  

### WordPress Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: Attackers compromised the developer’s site and inserted a PHP backdoor into manually downloaded plugin packages.  
- **Impact**: Sites installing the trojanized plugin hand over administrative access and visitor data to attackers.  
- **Status**: Malicious files removed; users advised to verify hashes and reinstall from WordPress.org repository.  

### McHire Weak Credential Exposure
- **Description**: The “McHire” recruitment chatbot used the password “123456” on a production database endpoint.  
- **Impact**: Unauthenticated access to chats from 64 million job applications, privacy violations, and potential social-engineering vectors.  
- **Status**: Credentials changed after disclosure; no systemic fix announced.  

### OpenVSX Extension Marketplace Zero-Day
- **Description**: Logic flaw in OpenVSX allowed attackers to overwrite popular extensions and push malicious updates to Cursor and Windsurf IDE users.  
- **Impact**: Supply-chain compromise of development environments leading to widespread workstation infection.  
- **Status**: Patched; no confirmed mass exploitation but window of exposure existed prior to fix.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Wing FTP Server**: All on-prem versions prior to latest hotfix  
- **Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway**: Appliance builds vulnerable to CVE-2025-5777 across on-prem and cloud editions  
- **Fortinet FortiWeb**: Versions prior to 7.4.2 and 7.0.7  
- **NVIDIA GPUs**: GDDR6-equipped cards (RTX 30-/40-series, H100, A100, L40S) when ECC disabled  
- **Laravel Applications**: Any app whose APP_KEY leaked via public GitHub repositories  
- **Vehicles & Devices (PerfektBlue)**: Mercedes, Škoda, Volkswagen, and any system embedding OpenSynergy BlueSDK ≤ v6.2  
- **WordPress Gravity Forms Plugin**: Manual installers downloaded between compromise window and takedown  
- **McHire Chatbot Platform**: U.S. deployments of Paradox-hosted recruitment system  
- **OpenVSX Marketplace**: All IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf) auto-syncing extensions before security patch  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Pre-Auth SQL Injection to RCE**: Malicious HTTP payload exploits blind SQLi (FortiWeb) to drop web-shells.  
- **Memory Disclosure & Session Hijacking**: Crafted requests leak NetScaler process memory, exposing auth tokens (CitrixBleed 2).  
- **Binary Bit-Flip (RowHammer)**: Rapid row activation flips GDDR6 bits, corrupting model weights (GPUHammer).  
- **Leaked Secret Forgery**: Attackers reuse APP_KEY to sign forged cookies, leading to PHP object injection (Laravel).  
- **1-Click Bluetooth RCE**: Malformed LMP and GATT frames trigger heap corruption in BlueSDK (PerfektBlue).  
- **Trojanized Update/Supply-Chain**: Backdoored ZIP installer delivers obfuscated PHP payload (Gravity Forms).  
- **Weak Credential Abuse**: Hard-coded password grants direct API/database access (McHire).  
- **Extension Takeover**: Marketplace logic flaw allowed namespace collision and malicious package upload (OpenVSX).  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unknown Mass Exploiters**  
  - **Campaign**: Automated scanning and exploitation of Wing FTP Server and FortiWeb instances for botnet expansion and ransomware staging.  

- **Pay2Key Ransomware-as-a-Service**  
  - **Activities**: Resurfaced with 80% revenue share for affiliates attacking U.S. and Israeli organizations; expected to integrate CitrixBleed 2 and Wing FTP exploits into intrusion toolkits.  

- **Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Intruders**  
  - **Campaign**: Compromised developer infrastructure to distribute backdoored plugins; aim appears to be large-scale WordPress site hijacking and credential harvesting.  

- **Researchers Demonstrating GPUHammer & PerfektBlue**  
  - **Activities**: Public proof-of-concept releases highlight feasibility, lowering barrier for real attackers.  

- **Unknown Actors Targeting McHire**  
  - **Campaign**: Evidence of unauthorized data access leveraging weak credentials; potential sale of applicant PII on dark web.  

- **OpenVSX Zero-Day Discoverer (Koi Security)**  
  - **Activities**: Responsible disclosure; no evidence malicious actors leveraged the flaw before patch but risk window noted.
