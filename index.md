## Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

1. **VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days**
   - **Source**: [Hackers exploit VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint zero-days at Pwn2Own](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-vmware-esxi-microsoft-sharepoint-zero-days-at-pwn2own/)
   - **Details**: During Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint were exploited. These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should apply patches released by VMware and Microsoft as soon as they become available and monitor for any unusual activity.

2. **Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT**
   - **Source**: [Turkish APT Exploits Chat App Zero-Day to Spy on Iraqi Kurds](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/turkish-apt-exploits-chat-app-zero-day-spy-iraqi-kurds)
   - **Details**: The Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle group exploited a zero-day vulnerability in a chat application to spy on military targets.
   - **Affected Systems**: Specific chat application used by Iraqi Kurds
   - **Mitigation**: Users should update to the latest version of the chat application and apply any available security patches.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Chrome Zero-Day**
   - **Source**: [CISA tags recently patched Chrome bug as actively exploited](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-tags-recently-patched-chrome-bug-as-actively-exploited-zero-day/)
   - **Details**: A high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser was actively exploited before being patched. The specific CVE ID was not mentioned.
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome
   - **Mitigation**: Users should ensure their Chrome browser is updated to the latest version to protect against this vulnerability.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Source**: [New 'Defendnot' tool tricks Windows into disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-defendnot-tool-tricks-windows-into-disabling-microsoft-defender/)
   - **Details**: The 'Defendnot' tool registers a fake antivirus product to disable Microsoft Defender on Windows devices.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should monitor for unauthorized changes to antivirus settings and ensure that Microsoft Defender is properly configured and active.

2. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Source**: [Dynamic DNS Emerges as Go-to Cyberattack Facilitator](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dynamic-dns-cyberattack-facilitator)
   - **Details**: Threat actors are using dynamic DNS services to obfuscate their activities and impersonate well-known brands.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement DNS filtering and monitoring to detect and block suspicious DNS activity.

3. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Source**: [Fileless Remcos RAT Delivered via LNK Files and MSHTA in PowerShell-Based Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fileless-remcos-rat-delivered-via-lnk.html)
   - **Details**: A new malware campaign uses PowerShell-based shellcode loaders to deploy Remcos RAT without leaving a trace on disk.
   - **Mitigation**: Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block fileless malware attacks.

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Marbled Dust/Sea Turtle**
   - **Activity**: Exploiting chat app zero-day to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Mitigation**: Enhance monitoring and patch management for applications used by potential targets.

2. **Scattered Spider and Other Phishers**
   - **Activity**: Using dynamic DNS to facilitate cyberattacks.
   - **Mitigation**: Strengthen phishing defenses and user awareness training.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

- **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems to the latest versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malware and fileless attacks.
- **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to identify and respond to suspicious activities.
- **User Training**: Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain a robust incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate security incidents.

By following these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation by threat actors.
