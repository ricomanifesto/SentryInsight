# Exploitation Report

Current threat intelligence reveals several critical exploitation activities affecting enterprise and consumer systems. The most significant activity includes a sophisticated spyware attack exploiting a recently patched Apple vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) that has prompted emergency security updates across multiple iOS versions. Additionally, a massive ad fraud operation called SlopAds has compromised 224 Android applications with 38 million downloads, while a self-replicating worm has infected over 187 JavaScript packages in the NPM repository. New social engineering campaigns are leveraging FileFix variants to deploy StealC information stealer malware, and researchers have demonstrated a novel Phoenix RowHammer attack that bypasses DDR5 memory protections in under two minutes.

## Active Exploitation Details
