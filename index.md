# Exploitation Report

A surge of critical, remotely exploitable vulnerabilities is driving active attacks against enterprise infrastructure, development pipelines, and consumer devices. Coordinated exploitation is now confirmed for Wing FTP Server (CVE-2025-47812), Fortinet FortiWeb (CVE-2025-25257), and Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway “CitrixBleed 2” (CVE-2025-5777), while opportunistic actors weaponize supply-chain compromises (Gravity Forms), leaked secrets in Laravel apps, and novel attack surfaces such as Google Gemini’s AI email summaries and the “PerfektBlue” Bluetooth flaws that threaten hundreds of millions of vehicles and IoT devices. Ransomware operators—most notably the Iranian-linked Pay2Key group—are incentivizing affiliates to leverage these weaknesses, underscoring the urgency for rapid patching and layered defenses.

## Active Exploitation Details

- **Status**: Actively exploited; CISA added to KEV catalog and mandated federal patching within 24 hours.  
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-5777  

### Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: The developer website for the popular WordPress plugin served trojanized installers containing a PHP backdoor that phones home and grants remote shells.  
- **Impact**: Site defacement, data exfiltration, and malware staging on WordPress installations.  
- **Status**: Malicious packages pulled; users must verify hashes and reinstall clean versions.  

### Google Gemini Email Summary Manipulation
- **Description**: Attackers craft emails whose content forces Gemini for Workspace to generate “helpful” summaries laced with malicious links or social-engineering prompts.  
- **Impact**: Phishing at scale without traditional attachments or URLs, bypassing security gateways.  
- **Status**: Technique observed in the wild; mitigations under review by Google.  

### Laravel APP_KEY Secret Leakage
- **Description**: Exposed `APP_KEY` values on GitHub let adversaries forge encrypted cookies and execute arbitrary code via deserialization attacks on Laravel applications.  
- **Impact**: Complete application compromise, database access, and credential dumping on over 600 publicly identified sites.  
- **Status**: Keys still exposed; admins must rotate secrets and audit repositories.  

### PerfektBlue Bluetooth Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Four flaws in OpenSynergy’s BlueSDK enable 1-click, over-the-air remote code execution against infotainment units and embedded devices.  
- **Impact**: Remote takeover of vehicle control units, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics; potential physical safety risks.  
- **Status**: No patches deployed in many downstream products; exploits feasible with commodity hardware.  

### GPUHammer RowHammer Variant
- **Description**: A GPU-centric RowHammer technique flips bits in GDDR6 memory, corrupting model weights and degrading AI inference accuracy.  
- **Impact**: Integrity attacks on AI workloads, denial-of-service, and possible privilege escalation.  
- **Status**: Demonstrated in research; NVIDIA advises enabling system-level ECC.  

### eSIM Oracle Vulnerability Abuse
- **Description**: A six-year-old Oracle flaw residing in eSIM management stacks allows remote or physical attackers to reprogram or clone eSIM profiles.  
- **Impact**: Device hijacking, covert surveillance, and fraudulent roaming charges across millions of smartphones.  
- **Status**: Under active investigation; heterogeneous patch landscape across carriers and OEMs.
