# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several significant cybersecurity incidents and exploitation activities have been identified. The most critical findings include North Korean threat actors conducting coordinated cyber espionage campaigns against diplomatic missions, the operation of the RapperBot botnet responsible for over 370,000 DDoS attacks, and the discovery of sophisticated evasion techniques targeting Linux systems. Additionally, new research has revealed zero-click exploits affecting AI agents with extensive system access, while domain resurrection attacks have been actively used to hijack accounts on software repositories.

## Active Exploitation Details
