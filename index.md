# Exploitation Report

Current exploitation activity reveals a concerning landscape dominated by zero-day vulnerabilities targeting critical infrastructure, AI-powered phishing campaigns, and sophisticated nation-state operations. The most critical developments include active exploitation of Cisco ASA firewall zero-day vulnerabilities by nation-state actors deploying custom malware, a CVSS 10.0 rated Fortra GoAnywhere flaw being exploited in the wild, and the emergence of AI-crafted phishing attacks using malicious SVG files to bypass email security systems. Chinese APT groups continue aggressive campaigns targeting telecommunications and manufacturing sectors across Asia, while ransomware operators are successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication on VPN systems.

## Active Exploitation Details
