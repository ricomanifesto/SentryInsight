# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals a concerning mix of memory-based attack vectors, insider threats, and operational disruptions. The most significant development is the emergence of the Phoenix attack, which successfully bypasses DDR5 memory protection mechanisms against Rowhammer attacks, demonstrating that even the latest hardware defenses can be circumvented. Additionally, a major insider breach at FinWise Bank has exposed sensitive data for 689,000 customers, highlighting the persistent threat posed by malicious insiders. Organizations are also facing operational challenges as Microsoft Exchange 2016 and 2019 approach end-of-support status, creating potential security gaps, while recent Windows updates have introduced compatibility issues affecting SMBv1 shares.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Phoenix Rowhammer Attack
- **Description**: A new variant of Rowhammer attacks developed by academic researchers that successfully bypasses the latest protection mechanisms implemented in DDR5 memory chips from SK Hynix
- **Impact**: Attackers can potentially manipulate memory contents by repeatedly accessing specific memory rows, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption
- **Status**: Research-phase attack with proof-of-concept demonstrated against current DDR5 defenses

### FinWise Bank Insider Breach
- **Description**: A former employee accessed sensitive files after their employment ended, compromising customer data
- **Impact**: Exposure of personal and financial information for 689,000 American First Finance customers
- **Status**: Breach confirmed and customers notified; investigation ongoing

## Affected Systems and Products

- **DDR5 Memory Chips**: SK Hynix DDR5 memory modules vulnerable to Phoenix Rowhammer attacks
- **FinWise Bank Systems**: Corporate customer data systems accessed by unauthorized former employee
- **Microsoft Exchange**: Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 servers approaching end-of-support in 30 days
- **Windows Systems**: September 2025 Windows security updates causing SMBv1 share connection issues
- **Windows 11**: Audio compatibility issues with Bluetooth headsets and speakers in version 24H2

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Memory Manipulation**: Phoenix attack exploits DDR5 memory through advanced Rowhammer techniques that circumvent built-in protections
- **Insider Access**: Unauthorized access to sensitive systems by former employees with retained system privileges
- **Browser-Based Attacks**: Increasing prevalence of attacks targeting users through web browsers, though specific techniques not detailed in available sources

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Academic Researchers**: Developed and disclosed the Phoenix Rowhammer attack variant demonstrating DDR5 defense bypass capabilities
- **Malicious Insiders**: Former FinWise Bank employee exploited retained access to compromise customer data systems
- **General Threat Landscape**: Weekly security reports indicate ongoing activities involving bootkit malware, AI-powered attacks, supply chain breaches, and zero-day exploits, though specific actor attributions were not provided in the source materials
