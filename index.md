# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting diverse platforms and systems. Most notably, Apple has patched a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-43300) that was actively exploited in sophisticated attacks against targeted individuals, potentially indicating nation-state or spyware operations. Meanwhile, threat actors continue to leverage social engineering tactics, with APT36 abusing Linux .desktop files for malware deployment, and new infostealer campaigns targeting Mac users through fake troubleshooting guides. Additionally, a significant hardware vulnerability in Dell laptops' ReVault system has exposed millions of devices to potential firmware-level compromise, while Chinese APT group Silk Typhoon maintains persistent cloud infrastructure attacks against North American organizations.
