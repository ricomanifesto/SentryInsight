# Exploitation Report

Several critical vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in the wild, representing significant threats to enterprise security. The most severe include a maximum severity command injection flaw in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035), multiple vulnerabilities in Ivanti EPMM systems (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) that have been weaponized with custom malware, and a recently patched critical authentication bypass in Microsoft Entra ID that could have enabled global admin impersonation across any tenant. Additionally, researchers have identified zero-click vulnerabilities in OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research agent that can be exploited to steal Gmail data invisibly. Nation-state actors are also leveraging these vulnerabilities alongside sophisticated social engineering campaigns to target telecommunications companies and conduct widespread espionage operations.
