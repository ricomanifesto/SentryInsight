# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats reveal a diverse landscape of active exploitation activities targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. The most significant developments include a critical Docker container escape vulnerability (CVE-2025-9074) with a CVSS score of 9.3, coordinated scanning campaigns against Microsoft RDP authentication servers involving nearly 2,000 IP addresses, and sophisticated attacks by the China-nexus threat actor UNC6384 targeting diplomatic entities. Additionally, multiple data breaches have impacted major organizations including Farmers Insurance (1.1 million customers affected) and French retailer Auchan (hundreds of thousands of customers), while Apple has issued urgent security updates for a dangerous flaw that may have already been exploited in sophisticated targeted attacks. Novel attack vectors are emerging, including AI-based attacks that hide malicious prompts in downscaled images and ClickFix attacks that manipulate AI-generated content summaries to distribute malware.
