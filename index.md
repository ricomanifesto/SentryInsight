# Exploitation Report

# Comprehensive Exploitation Activity Report

## Summary of Critical Exploitation Activity

This report provides an analysis of recent cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild. The focus is on zero-day vulnerabilities, recently patched vulnerabilities that were exploited, new attack vectors, and notable threat actors. The report also includes recommendations for mitigation.

## Exploited Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

### 1. Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

#### VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days
- **Event**: Pwn2Own Berlin 2025
- **Details**: Hackers successfully exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint.
- **Impact**: These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint
- **Mitigation**: Organizations using these platforms should apply the latest security patches and updates as soon as they are released.

#### Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT
- **Threat Actor**: Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle
- **Details**: Exploited a zero-day vulnerability in a chat application to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
- **Impact**: Enabled unauthorized access and surveillance of sensitive communications.
- **Affected Systems**: Specific chat applications used by targeted groups.
- **Mitigation**: Users should ensure applications are updated and consider using end-to-end encrypted communication tools.

### 2. Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

#### Chrome Zero-Day
- **CVE ID**: Not specified
- **Details**: CISA warned about ongoing attacks exploiting a high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser.
- **Impact**: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or bypass security restrictions.
- **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome
- **Mitigation**: Users should update Chrome to the latest version immediately.

### 3. New Attack Vectors and Techniques

#### Defendnot Tool
- **Details**: A tool that tricks Windows into disabling Microsoft Defender by registering a fake antivirus product.
- **Impact**: Leaves systems vulnerable to malware and other threats.
- **Affected Systems**: Windows devices
- **Mitigation**: Ensure that Microsoft Defender is active and regularly check for unauthorized changes in security settings.

#### Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator
- **Details**: Used by groups like Scattered Spider to obfuscate activities and impersonate brands.
- **Impact**: Facilitates phishing and other malicious activities.
- **Mitigation**: Monitor DNS traffic for anomalies and use DNS filtering solutions.

#### Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA
- **Details**: Uses PowerShell-based shellcode loader to deploy Remcos RAT.
- **Impact**: Enables remote access and control over infected systems.
- **Mitigation**: Disable execution of scripts via MSHTA and monitor for suspicious LNK files.

### 4. Critical Vulnerabilities with High Impact

#### Intel CPU Flaws
- **Details**: New flaws enabling memory leaks and Spectre v2 attacks.
- **Impact**: Potential for sensitive data leakage from memory.
- **Affected Systems**: All modern Intel CPUs
- **Mitigation**: Apply microcode updates from Intel and enable security features in the BIOS.

### 5. Notable Threat Actors and Activities

#### Ransomware Gangs Using Skitnet
- **Details**: Skitnet malware used for stealthy post-exploitation activities.
- **Impact**: Enhances the ability of ransomware gangs to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

#### HTTPBot Botnet
- **Details**: Launches precision DDoS attacks on gaming and tech sectors.
- **Impact**: Disrupts services and can cause significant downtime.
- **Mitigation**: Deploy DDoS protection services and monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems to the latest versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.
2. **Endpoint Security**: Deploy comprehensive endpoint protection solutions that include antivirus, anti-malware, and EDR capabilities.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to identify and respond to suspicious activities.
4. **User Education**: Conduct regular security awareness training to educate users about phishing, social engineering, and safe computing practices.
5. **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain a robust incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate security incidents.

By following these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation from these and other emerging threats.
