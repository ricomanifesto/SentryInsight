# Exploitation Report

Recent security updates highlight several actively exploited vulnerabilities in popular software and critical infrastructure. Cisco patched multiple flaws in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) solutions, Qualcomm addressed three actively exploited security issues, thousands of ASUS routers were hijacked to form a botnet, and Google released an emergency Chrome update to fix a zero-day exploited in the wild. Threat actors continue to employ techniques like ransomware attacks, vishing operations, and malicious supply-chain packages targeting open-source ecosystems.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) Flaws
- **Description**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Ciscoâ€™s ISE and CCP solutions, with public exploit code available. Attackers can leverage these flaws to bypass security restrictions or execute malicious code on the underlying systems.  
- **Impact**: Successful exploitation could allow privilege escalation within a corporate network, control over identity services, and unauthorized access to customer engagement data.  
- **Status**: Cisco has released patches; exploitation code is public, indicating threat actors may be actively targeting unpatched systems.

### Qualcomm Exploited Security Flaws
- **Description**: Three security flaws in Qualcomm chipsets have been exploited in the wild, affecting numerous devices that rely on Qualcomm hardware. These flaws allow attackers to potentially gain elevated privileges or exfiltrate sensitive data.  
- **Impact**: Compromise of mobile devices at the chipset level, leading to unauthorized data access or device manipulation.  
- **Status**: Qualcomm has issued fixes for these flaws, but devices remain at risk if manufacturers and users have not applied the necessary updates.

### ASUS Router Exploitation
- **Description**: Cybercriminals have compromised thousands of ASUS routers, repurposing them for a botnet. Attackers appear to be leveraging router misconfigurations or undisclosed exploits to gain remote control.  
- **Impact**: Hijacked routers can be used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data interception, or as an entry point into home and corporate networks.  
- **Status**: Active exploitation has been observed in the wild, and ASUS users are urged to apply the latest firmware and secure their devices.

### New Chrome Zero-Day
- **Description**: Google discovered a high-severity zero-day vulnerability in Chrome that attackers are using to compromise targets. The flaw permits malicious code execution or system takeover when users visit specially crafted websites.  
- **Impact**: Full browser or potential system compromise, data theft, and the ability for attackers to monitor user activity.  
- **Status**: Google released an emergency out-of-band patch; exploitation has been observed in the wild, indicating immediate update is essential.

## Affected Systems and Products
- **Cisco ISE and CCP**: Vulnerable versions that have not yet applied the latest Cisco patches  
- **Qualcomm-based Devices**: Mobile phones and IoT devices using unpatched Qualcomm chipsets  
- **ASUS Routers**: Various models found to be compromised into botnets  
- **Google Chrome**: Versions prior to the emergency out-of-band update  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Router Exploitation**: Attackers compromise home and small-business routers through outdated firmware or misconfiguration  
- **Publicly Available Exploit Code**: Malicious actors leverage published proof-of-concept exploits for Cisco products  
- **Zero-Day Browser Vulnerability**: Drive-by downloads and malicious websites target unpatched Chrome installations  
- **Social Engineering and Vishing**: Campaigns impersonate legitimate services to harvest credentials (UNC6040 targeting Salesforce)  
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious packages in PyPI, npm, and Ruby repositories install backdoors or steal data  
- **Kerberos AS-REP Roasting**: Attackers exploit missing Kerberos protections to crack user credentials  
- **Multi-Stage PowerShell Infection**: Fake DocuSign or Gitcode sites trick users into running malicious scripts for RAT deployment  
- **Malicious Mobile Apps**: Android Trojans like Crocodilus exploit banking and crypto wallets  

## Threat Actor Activities
- **Play Ransomware Gang**: Breached hundreds of organizations worldwide, including critical infrastructure  
- **Hacker Mining Crypto on Hosting Accounts**: Illegally accessed thousands of hosting environments for crypto-mining  
- **UNC6040 (Vishing Group)**: Conducts voice-phishing to compromise Salesforce data  
- **ShinyHunters (Claimed)**: Engages in data extortion campaigns targeting enterprise Salesforce instances  
- **Scattered Spider**: Executes help desk scams to infiltrate corporate accounts and escalate privileges  
- **Malicious Open-Source Package Actors**: Embed coin-stealing scripts and backdoors in popular development repositories  
- **Hacker Targeting Gamers and Researchers on GitHub**: Hides backdoors in exploit and cheat tools  
- **Chaos RAT Operators**: Disseminate fake network tool downloads to compromise Windows and Linux systems
