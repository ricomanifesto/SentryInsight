# Exploitation Report

Current cyberthreat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities requiring immediate attention. Most notably, Samsung has addressed a zero-day vulnerability in Android systems that was actively exploited in the wild, while CISA has issued warnings about ongoing exploitation of a critical remote code execution flaw in Dassault systems. Additionally, the FBI has identified two cybercriminal groups conducting sophisticated data theft campaigns targeting Salesforce platforms, and Apple has notified French users of a fourth spyware campaign in 2025. These incidents demonstrate the persistent threat of zero-day exploits and targeted attacks against enterprise platforms.
