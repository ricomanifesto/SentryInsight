# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is experiencing a surge of critical exploitation activities, with multiple zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited across various platforms. Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addressed a massive 172 security flaws, including six zero-day vulnerabilities with three confirmed to be under active exploitation. Particularly concerning is the exploitation of Oracle systems, including a zero-day vulnerability that affected Harvard University and was leveraged by the Clop ransomware group. Nation-state actors have also been highly active, with Chinese threat groups compromising F5 systems to steal source code and undisclosed vulnerabilities, while also maintaining persistent access through compromised ArcGIS servers for over a year. Additional exploitation activities include attacks against ICTBroadcast servers, SAP NetWeaver systems, and Red Lion industrial control systems.
