# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently facing a surge of critical zero-day exploitations, with Cisco infrastructure and Fortra GoAnywhere systems being primary targets of active attacks. Most notably, threat actors have been exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA firewalls and IOS software, with nation-state actors deploying sophisticated malware payloads including RayInitiator and LINE VIPER. A critical CVSS 10 vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere was exploited as a zero-day for approximately one week before public disclosure, while federal agencies have been compromised through exploitation of a GeoServer vulnerability (CVE-2024-36401) within just two weeks of its disclosure. Additional threats include new variants of macOS XCSSET malware targeting developers, malicious supply chain attacks through npm packages and Rust crates, and sophisticated backdoor deployments by Chinese APT groups on edge devices.

- **Status**: Currently being exploited in active attacks; CISA has issued emergency directive requiring federal agencies to patch immediately

### Fortra GoAnywhere Critical Flaw
- **Description**: A maximum CVSS 10 severity vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer software
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise allowing unauthorized access to managed file transfer systems
- **Status**: Exploited as zero-day for approximately one week before public disclosure; patches now available

### Cisco IOS SNMP Vulnerability
- **Description**: High-severity security flaw in IOS Software and IOS XE Software affecting SNMP functionality
- **Impact**: Remote code execution or denial-of-service conditions on affected network infrastructure
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; patches available

### GeoServer Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: Critical vulnerability in GeoServer geospatial software
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise allowing unauthorized access to federal agency systems
- **Status**: Exploited to breach federal civilian executive branch agency within two weeks of disclosure
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-36401

### Salesforce AI Agent Vulnerability (ForcedLeak)
- **Description**: Critical flaw in Salesforce Agentforce platform allowing indirect prompt injection attacks against AI agents
- **Impact**: Unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive CRM data through manipulated AI agent interactions
- **Status**: Recently patched by Salesforce following responsible disclosure

## Affected Systems and Products
