# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerability exploitation activity is surging across multiple platforms, with threat actors actively targeting infrastructure and enterprise systems. The most severe incidents include Chinese hackers exploiting a VMware zero-day vulnerability since October 2024, affecting VMware Aria Operations and VMware Tools. Additionally, CISA has issued urgent warnings about active exploitation of a critical Linux Sudo vulnerability (CVE-2025-32463) that enables root-level privilege escalation. Approximately 50,000 Cisco firewalls remain vulnerable to actively exploited flaws, while Western Digital My Cloud NAS devices face critical remote command injection vulnerabilities. These exploitation campaigns demonstrate sophisticated threat actors targeting foundational enterprise infrastructure components.
