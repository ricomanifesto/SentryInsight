# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting enterprise infrastructure and mobile platforms. Most notably, Russian threat actors are actively exploiting a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability to deploy stealer malware, while new ransomware variants are successfully bypassing endpoint detection and response systems. Additionally, Cisco has disclosed a maximum severity vulnerability in its Firewall Management Center that requires immediate patching, and telecommunications infrastructure is under active attack by ransomware groups. Mobile banking trojans continue to evolve with leaked source code enabling broader distribution of sophisticated Android malware.

## Active Exploitation Details

### MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A now-patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows being exploited by the Russian threat group EncryptHub
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to deploy Fickle Stealer malware for credential and data theft
- **Status**: Vulnerability is patched but continues to be actively exploited against unpatched systems

### Cisco Firewall Management Center RADIUS Vulnerability
- **Description**: Critical remote code execution vulnerability in the RADIUS subsystem of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center software
- **Impact**: Attackers can achieve remote code execution with maximum severity impact
- **Status**: Critical patch available - no mitigation or workaround exists, immediate patching required

### EDR Bypass Techniques
- **Description**: Crypto24 ransomware group has developed sophisticated methods to bypass endpoint detection and response systems
- **Impact**: Successful deployment of ransomware payloads while evading security controls
- **Status**: Active exploitation with demonstrated deep technical knowledge and skills
