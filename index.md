# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical vulnerabilities being actively exploited, with particular focus on enterprise infrastructure and cloud services. A critical Microsoft Entra ID token validation flaw posed significant risks by enabling global admin impersonation across any tenant, while Fortra GoAnywhere MFT systems face maximum severity command injection vulnerabilities. Threat actors are leveraging sophisticated social engineering techniques, including North Korean groups using ClickFix lures to deliver BeaverTail malware in cryptocurrency job scams, and Iranian APT groups targeting telecommunications companies with LinkedIn-based attacks. Additionally, novel attack vectors have emerged, including zero-click exploits targeting OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent that can exfiltrate Gmail data, and the discovery of GPT-4-powered malware capable of generating ransomware and reverse shells.
