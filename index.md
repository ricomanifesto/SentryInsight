# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. The most significant threat involves a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway products (CVE-2025-7775) that has been actively exploited by attackers. Additionally, sophisticated threat actors including Silk Typhoon and Blind Eagle are conducting targeted campaigns using advanced techniques such as captive portal hijacking and multi-cluster operations. A widespread OAuth token theft campaign has also compromised Salesloft's platform, exposing Salesforce customer data through exploitation of Drift AI chat agent vulnerabilities.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Citrix NetScaler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
- **Description**: Critical remote code execution flaw in NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway products that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise, potential network lateral movement, and unauthorized access to sensitive enterprise resources
