# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities in enterprise software are currently under active exploitation by sophisticated threat actors. The most significant activity involves Oracle E-Business Suite being exploited by the Cl0p ransomware group through CVE-2025-61882, enabling unauthenticated remote code execution. Simultaneously, attackers exploited a Zimbra Collaboration vulnerability (CVE-2025-27915) as a zero-day targeting Brazilian military systems using malicious iCalendar files. These incidents highlight the persistent threat of zero-day exploitation against enterprise infrastructure, with threat actors rapidly weaponizing vulnerabilities before patches become available.
