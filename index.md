# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat activity is dominated by several critical zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack campaigns. Google has addressed a sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability **CVE-2025-10585** affecting the V8 JavaScript engine that has been actively exploited in the wild. Concurrently, WatchGuard Firebox firewalls are facing a critical remote code execution vulnerability requiring immediate patching. The threat landscape is further complicated by advanced persistent threats, including TA558's AI-generated attack scripts targeting Brazilian hotels with Venom RAT, and ShinyHunters' massive data theft operation claiming 1.5 billion Salesforce records through compromised OAuth tokens. Multiple security breaches have also impacted major organizations including Insight Partners and SonicWall, while Microsoft has successfully disrupted the RaccoonO365 phishing-as-a-service operation.
