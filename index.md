# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting diverse platforms and systems. Russian state-sponsored groups continue their sophisticated operations with APT28 deploying the NotDoor malware to abuse Microsoft Outlook for covert data exfiltration. Meanwhile, threat actors are leveraging AI-powered tools like HexStrike-AI to rapidly exploit newly disclosed n-day vulnerabilities, significantly accelerating attack timelines. Google has addressed two actively exploited Android vulnerabilities in their September security update, while malicious actors are exploiting social media platforms and package repositories to distribute malware. Additionally, compromised router infrastructure continues to pose long-term security risks, with hacked devices remaining undetected for years.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Android Security Vulnerabilities
