# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing intense exploitation activity across multiple fronts, with several critical zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild. The most concerning developments include a maximum severity zero-day flaw in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT platform (CVE-2025-10035) allowing unauthenticated remote command injection, multiple actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA firewalls and IOS devices, and sophisticated malware campaigns targeting organizations worldwide. Chinese state-sponsored actors are deploying advanced backdoors on edge devices, while Iranian threat groups are leveraging legitimate SSL certificates to sign malware. Additionally, AI-powered attack vectors are emerging, with vulnerabilities discovered in Salesforce's AI agents that could expose sensitive CRM data through prompt injection attacks.
