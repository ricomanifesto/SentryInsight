# Exploitation Report

A critical wave of exploitation activity has emerged across multiple platforms and systems, with attackers targeting cloud identity management, file transfer solutions, mobile device management systems, and artificial intelligence platforms. The most significant threats include a critical Microsoft Entra ID token validation failure allowing global administrator impersonation across all tenants, a maximum severity command injection vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035), active exploitation of Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) with custom malware deployments, and a zero-click data exfiltration flaw in OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research agent. Nation-state actors, particularly from North Korea and Iran, continue to leverage sophisticated social engineering campaigns to deploy advanced malware and compromise telecommunications infrastructure.

## Active Exploitation Details

- **Impact**: Successful exploitation enables arbitrary command execution on affected systems, potentially leading to complete system compromise
- **Status**: Critical patch available from Fortra; exploitation highly dependent on Internet exposure
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-10035

### Ivanti EPMM Vulnerabilities Under Active Attack
- **Description**: Two vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) systems being actively exploited with custom malware deployment
- **Impact**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to deploy specialized malware toolkits for persistent access and lateral movement within enterprise networks
- **Status**: Active exploitation confirmed by CISA with detailed malware analysis published
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-4427, CVE-2025-4428

### ShadowLeak ChatGPT Zero-Click Data Exfiltration
- **Description**: Zero-click vulnerability in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent that enables Gmail data extraction through crafted email manipulation
- **Impact**: Attackers can steal sensitive Gmail inbox data without user interaction, exfiltrating company data through OpenAI's infrastructure while leaving no trace on enterprise systems
- **Status**: Disclosed vulnerability with potential for widespread exploitation
