# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing intense exploitation activity across multiple enterprise platforms and systems. Critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Oracle E-Business Suite and Zimbra Collaboration Suite have been actively exploited by major ransomware groups and state-sponsored actors. The Clop ransomware gang has successfully leveraged an Oracle EBS zero-day to target a wide range of customers, while threat actors impersonating the Libyan Navy exploited a Zimbra zero-day against Brazil's military using malicious calendar files. Additionally, the Storm-1175 cybercrime group has been conducting sustained ransomware attacks through a maximum severity GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability. These incidents highlight the persistent threat of zero-day exploitation combined with sophisticated social engineering tactics across enterprise collaboration and file transfer platforms.
