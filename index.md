# Exploitation Report

Critical security incidents are unfolding across multiple fronts, with active exploitation targeting enterprise infrastructure and cloud services. The most severe threats include CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428 in Ivanti EPMM systems, which are being actively exploited by malware strains discovered by CISA. Additionally, Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT platform faces a maximum severity command injection vulnerability requiring immediate patching. Russian state-sponsored groups are intensifying operations through collaborative campaigns, while proxy botnets like SystemBC are compromising thousands of VPS systems daily. Supply chain attacks continue to plague the Python ecosystem, and enterprise security breaches are exposing critical infrastructure data.
