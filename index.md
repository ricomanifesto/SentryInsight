# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security concerns, with active exploitation targeting enterprise infrastructure and consumer devices. Most notably, a Russian threat group called EncryptHub is actively exploiting a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability to deploy the Fickle Stealer malware, while a security researcher has released a proof-of-concept exploit for an authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewalls. Additionally, the complete source code leak of ERMAC 3.0 banking trojan has exposed the full malware infrastructure, potentially enabling widespread Android banking attacks. New ransomware variants like Crypto24 are demonstrating advanced EDR bypass capabilities, and Cisco has issued urgent patches for a critical vulnerability in their Firewall Management Center with no available workarounds.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft Windows MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security flaw in Microsoft Windows that has been patched but continues to be exploited by threat actors
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to deploy malicious payloads including the Fickle Stealer malware for credential theft and system compromise
- **Status**: Patched by Microsoft but actively exploited in the wild by EncryptHub group

### FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiWeb web application firewall
- **Impact**: Allows remote attackers to completely bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to protected systems
- **Status**: Proof-of-concept exploit code has been released by security researchers, increasing risk of widespread exploitation

### Cisco Firewall Management Center Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical security hole in Cisco's Firewall Management Center with a severity rating of 10
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise with no available mitigations or workarounds
- **Status**: Recently patched by Cisco with urgent recommendations for immediate deployment

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Windows**: All versions affected by the MSC EvilTwin vulnerability, actively targeted by EncryptHub group
