# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are actively being exploited across multiple platforms, with the most severe threats targeting Cisco firewall infrastructure and file transfer systems. The Fortra GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) represents an immediate threat with its maximum CVSS 10.0 severity rating, allowing remote command injection without authentication. Simultaneously, Cisco ASA firewall zero-days are being exploited by nation-state actors to deploy sophisticated malware, prompting emergency response directives from CISA. Chinese APT groups continue their aggressive targeting of telecommunications and manufacturing sectors across Asia, while ransomware attacks against supply chains have impacted major automotive manufacturers. The threat landscape shows increased sophistication in malware distribution through compromised npm packages and phishing campaigns impersonating government agencies.
