# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats reveal a sophisticated landscape of active exploitation targeting cloud environments, Linux systems, and mobile platforms. Chinese state-sponsored groups are leveraging trusted cloud relationships to compromise downstream customers, while multiple malware campaigns exploit known vulnerabilities in GeoServer and exposed Redis servers. Notable activities include APT36's abuse of Linux .desktop files for malware installation, new Mac-targeting infostealer campaigns, and supply chain attacks through malicious Go modules. The threat landscape demonstrates attackers' evolution beyond traditional botnets toward more targeted, platform-specific exploitation methods.
