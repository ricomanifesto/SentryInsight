# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewalls, exploitation of a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability by Russian threat actors, and the emergence of new ransomware variants with advanced EDR evasion capabilities. Additionally, the complete source code leak of ERMAC 3.0 banking trojan has exposed sophisticated Android malware infrastructure, potentially enabling widespread mobile banking attacks.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewall that allows remote attackers to completely bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected web applications and potentially compromise entire network infrastructures
- **Status**: Proof of concept exploit has been released by security researchers, increasing risk of widespread exploitation

### Microsoft Windows MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security flaw in Microsoft Windows that has been patched but continues to be exploited by threat actors
- **Impact**: Enables deployment of malicious payloads including information-stealing malware
- **Status**: Actively exploited by Russian threat group EncryptHub despite patches being available

### Cisco Firewall Management Center Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: A level 10 critical security hole in Cisco's Firewall Management Center with no available mitigation or workaround
- **Impact**: Complete compromise of firewall management infrastructure
- **Status**: Recently patched by Cisco with urgent deployment recommended

## Affected Systems and Products

- **FortiWeb Web Application Firewall**: All versions vulnerable to authentication bypass attacks
- **Microsoft Windows**: Systems running unpatched versions susceptible to MSC EvilTwin exploitation
- **Cisco Firewall Management Center**: Critical vulnerability requiring immediate patching
- **Android Devices**: Mobile banking applications targeted by ERMAC 3.0 trojan variants
- **Enterprise Networks**: Organizations using affected firewall and security management systems
