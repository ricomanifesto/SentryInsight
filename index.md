- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected systems, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; patches have been released by Microsoft.
- **CVE ID**: Not explicitly mentioned.

### Microsoft RCE Zero-Day
- **Description**: A remote code execution vulnerability exploited by the Stealth Falcon APT group.
- **Impact**: Enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems, posing a significant risk to sensitive data and operations.
- **Status**: Actively exploited; patched as part of Microsoft's June 2025 updates.
- **CVE ID**: Not explicitly mentioned.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Windows**: Various versions affected by the WebDAV and RCE vulnerabilities.
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot**: Vulnerable to the zero-click AI data leak flaw.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **WebDAV Exploitation**: Attackers leverage the WebDAV protocol to execute malicious payloads remotely.
- **Zero-Click AI Data Leak**: The EchoLeak vulnerability allows data exfiltration without user interaction, exploiting the AI capabilities of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Actor/Group**: Stealth Falcon
  - **Activities**: Targeting defense and government organizations in the Middle East using a Microsoft RCE zero-day.
  - **Campaign**: Focused on exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and control over sensitive systems.

- **Actor/Group**: General Cybercriminals
  - **Activities**: Utilizing brute-force attacks against Apache Tomcat management panels, indicating a rise in automated attack campaigns.
  - **Campaign**: Coordinated efforts observed using hundreds of unique IP addresses to compromise exposed management interfaces.

This report emphasizes the importance of vigilance in cybersecurity practices, particularly in patch management and monitoring for unusual activities that may indicate exploitation attempts.
