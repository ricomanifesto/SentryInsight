# Exploitation Report

Recent intelligence highlights a surge in exploitation of unpatched Ivanti Connect Secure Appliance (CSA) zero-day flaws that are giving attackers direct entry into government and telecom networks across France and other regions. Chinese state-sponsored operators and at least one China-nexus initial-access broker are actively abusing the vulnerabilities, even going so far as to “self-patch” compromised appliances to monopolize access. Concurrently, browser-based social-engineering attacks such as the new “ClickFix” Mark-of-the-Web bypass are lowering the barrier to malware delivery. These developments underscore the critical need for rapid patching, continuous monitoring of edge devices, and user awareness against emerging phishing vectors.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Ivanti Connect Secure Appliance (CSA) Zero-Day Chain
- **Description**: A pair of previously unknown vulnerabilities in Ivanti CSA enabling remote, unauthenticated command injection and server-side request forgery, allowing full device takeover.  
- **Impact**: Attackers gain arbitrary code execution on the VPN gateway, pivot into internal networks, steal credentials, and deploy additional payloads.  
- **Status**: Being actively exploited in the wild. Ivanti has issued out-of-band patches; many appliances remain unpatched.  
- **CVE ID**: *Not explicitly provided in the source articles*

### Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) “ClickFix” Bypass
- **Description**: An attack technique abusing how modern browsers save HTML files locally, stripping the MotW alternate data stream and thus disabling standard SmartScreen & Protected-View warnings.  
- **Impact**: Allows delivery and execution of malicious files without user security prompts, facilitating phishing-driven malware installs.  
- **Status**: Observed in active campaigns; no vendor patch because the issue leverages intended browser behavior rather than a discrete flaw.

## Affected Systems and Products
- **Ivanti Connect Secure Appliance (formerly Pulse Secure VPN)**  
  - Affected versions: All unpatched releases prior to Ivanti’s emergency update  
  - Platform: Network perimeter VPN gateways (hardware and virtual appliances)  

- **Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Chromium-based browsers (ClickFix MotW bypass)**  
  - Affected versions: All current desktop editions where users can save HTML files locally  
  - Platform: Windows endpoints (MotW is a Windows security feature)

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Zero-Day Command Injection & SSRF**  
  - Vector: Crafted HTTPS requests sent to vulnerable Ivanti CSA endpoints without authentication.  
  - Technique: Chain of logic flaw and input sanitization failure enables shell command execution as root.

- **Self-Patching Post-Exploitation**  
  - Vector: After initial compromise, actors deploy their own patched binaries or config changes to close exploited holes.  
  - Technique: “Turf control” — prevents other threat groups from using the same zero-day and complicates incident response.

- **MotW/ClickFix HTML Save Bypass**  
  - Vector: Malicious HTML e-mail attachment or web download saved by victim; when reopened, file lacks MotW flag.  
  - Technique: Social-engineering; leverages default browser save mechanics to suppress security dialogs.

- **QR-Code Phishing & Malware Delivery**  
  - Vector: PNG/PDF QR codes embedded in e-mails or physical media redirect to credential-harvesters or malware installers.  
  - Technique: Exploits user trust in QR codes and mobile devices.

- **AI-Generated Phishing Sites**  
  - Vector: Rapidly produced fake Okta and Microsoft 365 login portals built with LLMs in under a minute.  
  - Technique: Automates social-engineering infrastructure at scale.

## Threat Actor Activities
- **Chinese State-Sponsored Group (unnamed in articles)**  
  - Campaign: Targeting French government, telecom, media, finance, and transport entities via Ivanti CSA zero-days.  
  - Activities: Data exfiltration, lateral movement, persistent network access.

- **China-Nexus Initial Access Broker**  
  - Campaign: Exploits the same Ivanti flaws, then patches devices to retain exclusive foothold; selling access on underground markets.

- **Cyber-criminal Phishing Groups**  
  - Campaign: Broad distribution of QR-code phishing e-mails and AI-generated credential-harvesters impersonating Microsoft, PayPal, DocuSign, etc.  
  - Activities: Credential theft, malware delivery, follow-on BEC fraud.
