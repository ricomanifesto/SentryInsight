# Exploitation Report

Current threat intelligence reveals several critical security incidents affecting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Nation-state actors, particularly Russian-linked groups, are actively targeting water and wastewater systems across multiple countries including Norway and Poland. A maximum-severity vulnerability in Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center has been disclosed with a CVSS score of 10.0, allowing remote code execution. Additionally, Plex has issued urgent security warnings for users to patch a recently discovered vulnerability in their media servers. The cybercrime ecosystem continues to evolve with sophisticated phishing techniques bypassing FIDO authentication and government email credentials being sold on dark web marketplaces.

- **FIDO Authentication Systems**: Multi-factor authentication implementations vulnerable to downgrade attacks
- **Government Email Systems**: Police and government email accounts being compromised and sold

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Remote Code Execution**: Exploitation of Cisco FMC RADIUS vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution
- **Downgrade Attacks**: Phishing kits using techniques to bypass FIDO authentication by forcing less secure authentication methods
- **Infrastructure Targeting**: Direct attacks on critical water system infrastructure and control systems
- **Credential Harvesting**: Compromise and sale of government and law enforcement email credentials on dark web marketplaces
- **Phishing Campaigns**: Advanced phishing techniques specifically designed to circumvent modern authentication protections

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Russian Nation-State Actors**: Actively targeting water and wastewater systems in Norway and Poland as part of broader critical infrastructure attacks
- **Cybercriminal Groups**: Operating sophisticated phishing operations that bypass FIDO authentication and selling government email access on dark web platforms
- **Ransomware Operators**: Continued use of cryptocurrency exchanges like Garantex and Grinex for money laundering operations, with over $100 million in illicit transactions leading to U.S. sanctions
- **Dark Web Vendors**: Auctioning live government and police email credentials, providing other criminals access to sensitive systems and confidential intelligence
