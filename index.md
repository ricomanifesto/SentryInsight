# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity landscape shows significant active exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors and platforms. Critical threats include sophisticated Android banking trojans targeting European users, nation-state actors exploiting VMware vulnerabilities for extended periods, and ransomware operations targeting major software providers. Hardware-level attacks are demonstrating new techniques to compromise processor security features, while threat actors are leveraging social engineering and supply chain attacks to gain initial access to enterprise environments. The emergence of new backdoors and the continued exploitation of industrial systems highlight the expanding attack surface facing organizations globally.
