# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. Iranian threat actors have successfully compromised over 100 embassy email accounts through coordinated spear-phishing campaigns targeting diplomatic missions across Europe and other regions. Additionally, CISA has added TP-Link and WhatsApp vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation in the wild. A significant supply chain attack has impacted hundreds of organizations through OAuth token theft targeting Salesloft's Drift platform, forcing the service offline. Meanwhile, cybercriminals attempted a massive $130 million bank heist by breaching a fintech firm's environment connected to Brazil's real-time payment system.
