# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals significant exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors, with particular focus on supply chain attacks, ransomware operations, and advanced persistent threat campaigns. The most critical activity includes Salt Typhoon's exploitation of network infrastructure vulnerabilities affecting over 600 organizations globally, a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting the Nx build system that compromised thousands of credentials, and ransomware groups successfully breaching major organizations including MathWorks and TransUnion. These incidents demonstrate the evolving tactics of threat actors who are increasingly targeting cloud infrastructure, software supply chains, and leveraging legitimate tools for malicious purposes.
