# Exploitation Report

Recent security disclosures highlight critical vulnerabilities and ongoing exploitation campaigns targeting core network infrastructure, mobile chipsets, and consumer routers. Organizations using Cisco’s Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) face heightened exposure due to publicly available exploit code. Qualcomm has patched multiple flaws confirmed to be under active exploitation, while compromised ASUS routers underscore the persistent threat to consumer and SOHO networking devices. These developments underscore the urgency for immediate patching, rigorous configuration reviews, and robust monitoring strategies to thwart adversarial campaigns.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Authentication Bypass
- **Description**: A critical flaw allowing unauthorized attackers to bypass authentication in Cisco ISE deployments, including those on AWS, Azure, and OCI.
- **Impact**: Threat actors could gain administrator-level access, enabling them to modify policies, exfiltrate deeply sensitive data, or pivot further into corporate networks.
- **Status**: Security patches have been released, and active exploitation has been observed via publicly disclosed exploit code.

### Cisco Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Multiple vulnerabilities in the CCP solution enable attackers to execute privileged actions or potentially compromise user sessions.
- **Impact**: Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, service disruption, or lateral movement into connected systems through a high-privilege foothold.
- **Status**: Patches are available; exploit code is publicly accessible, elevating the risk of opportunistic attacks.

### Qualcomm Exploited Security Flaws
- **Description**: Three critical vulnerabilities in Qualcomm chipsets used in mobile and IoT devices have been exploited in the wild. These flaws can enable code execution or device compromise.
- **Impact**: Attackers could gain deep-level access on affected devices, potentially leading to data siphoning, unauthorized surveillance, or sabotage of foundational system processes.
- **Status**: Qualcomm has released fixes, but downstream manufacturers must still integrate patches into respective device firmware to close the attack window.

### ASUS Router Botnet Exploit
- **Description**: Threat actors are leveraging weaknesses in ASUS router configurations or firmware to conscript large numbers of devices into a botnet.
- **Impact**: Compromised routers can be controlled remotely to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, facilitate malware distribution, or intercept network traffic from unsuspecting victims.
- **Status**: Ongoing exploitation is reported, with users advised to update firmware, enable strong credentials, and disable unneeded remote management features.

## Affected Systems and Products
- **Cisco ISE**: Deployed on premises and in public clouds (AWS, Azure, OCI)  
- **Cisco CCP**: Customer Collaboration Platform across various business environments  
- **Qualcomm chipsets**: Found in numerous mobile and IoT devices where manufacturers must apply patches  
- **ASUS Routers**: Potentially outdated or misconfigured consumer and SOHO router models  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious Ruby gems and fake software updates impersonate legitimate packages to inject malware.  
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Chaos RAT distributed via bogus network tools, targeting Windows and Linux.  
- **Router Exploitation**: Unauthorized access resulting from outdated firmware or weak configurations in ASUS devices.  
- **Phishing and Vishing**: Social engineering campaigns targeting Salesforce credentials (UNC6040) and device code–based authentication flows.  
- **Deepfake Replay Attacks**: Bypassing voice authentication systems by re-recording deepfake audio in natural environments.  

## Threat Actor Activities
- **BladedFeline (Iran-linked)**: Targeting Iraqi and Kurdish government officials with advanced stealth malware campaigns.  
- **ViLE Gang**: Involved in extortion schemes, including breaching a federal law enforcement portal.  
- **Interlock Ransomware**: Responsible for a healthcare breach at Kettering Health, leaking stolen data.  
- **Play Ransomware**: Compromised approximately 900 victims, including critical infrastructure targets.  
- **BidenCash Marketplace**: Subject to a joint international takedown targeting a carding operation.  
- **UNC6040**: Deployed voice phishing (vishing) to infiltrate Salesforce accounts for data theft and extortion.  
- **Hedera Hashgraph Wallet Scams**: Attackers orchestrating NFT airdrop fraud to siphon digital currency.  
- **Malicious RubyGems**: Impersonating legitimate plugins to exfiltrate confidential Telegram data.  
- **Chaos RAT Operators**: Leveraging cross-platform malware to compromise Windows and Linux environments.
