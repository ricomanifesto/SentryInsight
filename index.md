# Exploitation Report

Recent intelligence highlights an uptick in precision attacks that chain mis-configurations with true zero-day exploits. The most critical activity involves an unidentified North-American threat actor weaponizing an unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability to breach Chinese targets, while the Gold Melody Initial-Access Broker is abusing exposed ASP.NET machine keys to sell footholds in corporate networks. These campaigns demonstrate that attackers increasingly favor weaknesses that grant immediate server-side code execution or authentication bypass and then monetize that access through brokerage or strategic espionage.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft Exchange Server Zero-Day
- **Description**: An unknown logic flaw in on-premises Exchange enables remote unauthenticated attackers to gain code-execution and mailbox access.
- **Impact**: Full compromise of the Exchange host, email theft, lateral movement into internal networks.
- **Status**: Actively exploited by a North-American APT; Microsoft has not yet released a patch, temporary mitigations recommended (URL-rewrite rules & EDR hardening).

### Exposed ASP.NET Machine Key Abuse
- **Description**: Threat actors leverage publicly leaked or weak `machineKey` values in ASP.NET applications to forge authentication cookies and view-state data.
- **Impact**: Authentication bypass, arbitrary code execution, and the ability to pivot into connected infrastructure.
- **Status**: Gold Melody IAB is currently selling access gained via this vector; remediation requires regenerating secrets and rotating session keys.

## Affected Systems and Products
- **Microsoft Exchange Server (on-premises)**  
  Platform: Windows Server environments hosting Exchange 2016, 2019, and out-of-support versions still deployed in production.

- **ASP.NET Web Applications**  
  Platform: IIS-hosted .NET Framework / .NET Core sites where `machineKey` values are static, predictable, or accidentally published to public repos.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Server-Side Authentication Bypass**  
  Vector: Crafting forged session or OAuth tokens to sidestep Exchange authentication pipelines.

- **Cookie Forgery via Leaked `machineKey`**  
  Vector: Using exposed ASP.NET configuration secrets to sign malicious auth cookies and execute deserialized payloads.

- **Initial Access Brokering**  
  Vector: Compromised assets are resold on underground forums to ransomware crews and espionage-focused buyers.

## Threat Actor Activities
- **Actor/Group**: Unnamed North-American APT  
  - **Campaign**: Exchange zero-day exploitation against Chinese government-affiliated entities; objectives include email exfiltration and strategic intelligence gathering.

- **Actor/Group**: Gold Melody Initial-Access Broker  
  - **Campaign**: Large-scale scanning for exposed ASP.NET machine keys, automated cookie forging, and sale of resulting access on dark-web marketplaces.
