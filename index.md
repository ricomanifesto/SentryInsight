   - **Details**: CISA warned about a high-severity vulnerability in Chrome that was actively exploited.
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome users.
   - **Mitigation**: Update Chrome to the latest version and enable automatic updates.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Source**: [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-defendnot-tool-tricks-windows-into-disabling-microsoft-defender/)
   - **Details**: The 'Defendnot' tool disables Microsoft Defender by registering a fake antivirus product.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices.
   - **Mitigation**: Ensure that Microsoft Defender is correctly configured and monitor for unauthorized changes to security settings.

2. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Source**: [DarkReading](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dynamic-dns-cyberattack-facilitator)
   - **Details**: Threat actors use dynamic DNS to obfuscate activities and impersonate brands.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement DNS filtering and monitor for unusual DNS queries.

3. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Source**: [TheHackerNews](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fileless-remcos-rat-delivered-via-lnk.html)
   - **Details**: A PowerShell-based shellcode loader is used to deploy Remcos RAT.
   - **Mitigation**: Disable MSHTA and LNK file execution where possible, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Scattered Spider and Other Phishers**
   - **Source**: [DarkReading](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/dynamic-dns-cyberattack-facilitator)
   - **Details**: These groups use dynamic DNS to facilitate phishing and other attacks.

2. **Ransomware Gangs Using Skitnet**
   - **Source**: [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gangs-increasingly-use-skitnet-post-exploitation-malware/)
   - **Details**: Skitnet is used for stealthy post-exploitation activities.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust backup solutions and conduct regular security audits.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems and applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy comprehensive endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malicious activities.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns and potential intrusions.
4. **User Education**: Conduct regular security awareness training for employees to recognize phishing and social engineering attacks.
5. **Incident Response**: Develop and regularly update incident response plans to quickly address and mitigate security incidents.

By following these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation from these vulnerabilities.
