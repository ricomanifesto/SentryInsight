# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting enterprise infrastructure and consumer applications. The most significant threats include Akira ransomware group's active exploitation of SonicWall SSL VPN vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, Chinese APT groups deploying advanced fileless malware frameworks against military targets, and sophisticated browser extension hijacking campaigns targeting Meta Business accounts. Additional concerns include AsyncRAT malware leveraging legitimate remote management tools, massive NPM supply chain attacks affecting cloud environments, and code execution vulnerabilities in AI development tools. These exploitation activities demonstrate adversaries' focus on infrastructure access, credential theft, and supply chain compromise.
