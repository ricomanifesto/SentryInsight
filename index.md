# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are currently under active exploitation by sophisticated threat actors, with Oracle E-Business Suite and Zimbra Collaboration systems being primary targets. The Cl0p ransomware group has been exploiting CVE-2025-61882 in Oracle systems for data theft attacks, while Brazilian military organizations were targeted through CVE-2025-27915 in Zimbra systems earlier this year. Additionally, a surge in reconnaissance activity against Palo Alto Networks login portals indicates potential preparation for future attacks, and multiple malware families including XWorm, Rhadamanthys, and SORVEPOTEL are demonstrating enhanced capabilities for data theft and system compromise.
