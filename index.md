# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting diverse systems and platforms. Iranian state-sponsored actors are conducting extensive phishing operations against diplomatic and governmental targets across six continents, while Russian APT28 has deployed new malware specifically targeting Microsoft Outlook for covert data exfiltration. Threat actors are increasingly leveraging AI-powered tools like HexStrike-AI to rapidly exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, and malicious actors are abusing legitimate platforms including X's Grok AI and npm packages to distribute malware. Google has addressed two actively exploited Android vulnerabilities in their September security update, highlighting ongoing mobile platform targeting.
