# Exploitation Report

Organizations worldwide are grappling with multiple active exploitation campaigns targeting both enterprise software and consumer devices. Recent security disclosures point to critical flaws in ConnectWise ScreenConnect, Asus routers, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP), as well as Qualcomm-based devices. Attackers have leveraged these vulnerabilities to achieve unauthorized access, create botnets, and perform other malicious activities, underscoring an urgent need for patching and enhanced security measures.

## Active Exploitation Details

### ConnectWise ScreenConnect Flaw
- **Description**: A vulnerability in the ConnectWise ScreenConnect remote support software that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access.  
- **Impact**: Potential remote takeover of customer endpoints.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited; a patch has been issued by ConnectWise.

### Asus Router Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Flaws in Asus routers that have enabled cybercriminals to compromise thousands of devices, leveraging them in botnet operations.  
- **Impact**: Attackers can hijack routers to launch further attacks, steal data, or conduct malicious traffic.  
- **Status**: Confirmed active exploitation, though official patching guidance may vary by router model.

### Cisco ISE Auth Bypass Flaw
- **Description**: A critical authentication bypass issue impacting Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) deployments in cloud environments.  
- **Impact**: Allows unauthenticated attackers to carry out malicious actions on ISE-managed networks.  
- **Status**: Exploit code is publicly available; Cisco has released patches.

### Cisco CCP Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Multiple flaws in the Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP) used by Cisco for customer engagement, exposing the solution to remote attacks.  
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute unauthorized actions, potentially compromising enterprise communication systems.  
- **Status**: Public exploit code is available; security updates have been issued by Cisco.

### Qualcomm Exploited Security Flaws
- **Description**: Three high-severity vulnerabilities in Qualcomm chipsets that have been exploited in the wild.  
- **Impact**: Potential for privilege escalation, code execution, or device compromise.  
- **Status**: Qualcomm has released patches, but the fixes must be applied by device manufacturers before users receive them.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **ConnectWise ScreenConnect**: Remote support software commonly used by MSPs and IT teams.  
- **Asus Routers**: Various consumer and small-business router models.  
- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)**: Deployed on public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and OCI.  
- **Cisco Customer Collaboration Platform (CCP)**: Cloud-based collaboration and customer engagement solution.  
- **Qualcomm-Based Devices**: Smartphones and IoT devices utilizing Qualcomm chipsets.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Remote Exploit/Service Compromise**: Attackers leverage unpatched flaws (e.g., in ScreenConnect, Cisco ISE/CCP) to gain unauthorized access or bypass authentication.  
- **Botnet Infiltration**: Asus routers are compromised en masse and added to malicious botnets.  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploitation of Qualcomm flaws for elevated permissions and deeper system access.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Bitter APT**: Continues to evolve tactics, focusing on intelligence gathering.  
- **BladedFeline (Iran-Linked)**: Conducting cyber-espionage against Iraqi and Kurdish targets using custom malware.  
- **UNC6040**: Employs voice phishing (vishing) campaigns to target Salesforce data.  
- **Interlock Ransomware**: Claims responsibility for healthcare breaches, leaking stolen information.  
- **Play Ransomware**: Breached hundreds of global organizations, including critical infrastructure.  
- **BidenCash**: Dark web carding marketplace targeted by law enforcement in a coordinated domain seizure.  
- **ViLE Gang**: Engaged in extortion after breaching law enforcement portals.  
- **RedLine**: Infostealer malware linked to state-sponsored threat actors.
