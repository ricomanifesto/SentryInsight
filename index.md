# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiWeb web application firewall, exploitation of a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability by Russian threat actors, and the exposure of a complete Android banking trojan infrastructure. Additionally, Cisco has released patches for a critical vulnerability in their Firewall Management Center that requires immediate attention due to the lack of available mitigations.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
- **Description**: A vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewall that allows remote attackers to completely bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Full authentication bypass enabling unauthorized access to protected systems and potential complete system compromise
- **Status**: Proof of concept exploit has been released by security researchers, making this vulnerability highly exploitable

### Microsoft Windows MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security flaw in Microsoft Windows that has been patched but continues to be exploited by threat actors
- **Impact**: Enables deployment of malicious payloads including information-stealing malware
- **Status**: Patched by Microsoft but actively exploited by Russian cybercriminal groups

### ERMAC 3.0 Android Banking Trojan
- **Description**: Complete source code leak of ERMAC version 3.0 Android banking trojan exposing the entire malware infrastructure
- **Impact**: Enables widespread deployment of banking trojans targeting Android devices for financial theft
- **Status**: Source code publicly available, significantly lowering the barrier for cybercriminals to deploy this malware

### Cisco Firewall Management Center Critical Vulnerability
