# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats are dominated by sophisticated nation-state actors and insider threats targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Chinese espionage groups including Murky Panda, Genesis, and Glacial Panda are actively exploiting cloud and telecommunications environments through trusted relationship abuse. Meanwhile, insider threats continue to pose significant risks, as demonstrated by a recent case where a former developer deployed custom kill-switch malware against his previous employer. Ransomware operations remain highly active, with groups like Warlock targeting telecommunications companies and healthcare organizations, while the Scattered Spider collective continues to conduct high-profile cyberattacks despite law enforcement actions.
