# Exploitation Report

A critical zero-day vulnerability allowing sandbox escape in Google Chrome is being actively exploited in the wild. Google has released emergency patches across all desktop platforms after observing real-world attacks that leverage the flaw to break out of Chrome’s security boundary and achieve arbitrary code execution on the underlying operating system. Rapid update adoption is strongly advised, as exploitation has already been confirmed by both Google and independent researchers.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Google Chrome Sandbox Escape Zero-Day
- **Description**: A high-severity flaw in Google Chrome that permits attackers to escape the browser’s sandbox. Successful exploitation lets malicious code execute with the privileges of the logged-in user, bypassing Chrome’s process isolation.
- **Impact**: Full compromise of the host system when a victim visits a malicious or compromised website. Attackers gain the ability to install programs, view/modify data, and create new accounts.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; Google has issued security updates for all supported desktop channels.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-6558

## Affected Systems and Products
- **Google Chrome prior to 126.0.x (Stable)**  
  - **Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Attack Vectors and Techniques
- **Drive-By Web Exploit**  
  - **Vector**: Users are lured to malicious or compromised websites that contain exploit code triggering the sandbox escape flaw.
- **Malvertising / Water-Holing**  
  - **Vector**: Injection of exploit scripts into legitimate ad networks or high-traffic sites to broaden reach and compromise unpatched browsers at scale.

## Threat Actor Activities
- **Unknown/Unattributed Threat Actors**  
  - **Campaign**: Active, opportunistic exploitation observed globally. Attackers are incorporating the vulnerability into exploit kits and custom loaders to gain initial foothold on endpoints running outdated Chrome versions.
