- **Details**: Ransomware gangs are deploying Skitnet malware for stealthy post-exploitation activities.
- **Affected Systems**: Networks compromised by ransomware.
- **Mitigation**: Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and conduct regular threat hunting exercises.

### 7. Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files
- **Source**: [Fileless Remcos RAT Delivered via LNK Files and MSHTA in PowerShell-Based Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fileless-remcos-rat-delivered-via-lnk.html)
- **Details**: A new campaign uses LNK files and MSHTA to deliver the Remcos RAT via PowerShell, bypassing traditional antivirus solutions.
- **Affected Systems**: Windows systems.
- **Mitigation**: Disable execution of scripts via MSHTA and educate users on the risks of opening unknown LNK files.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches, especially for critical software like VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint, and Google Chrome.

2. **Network Monitoring**: Implement robust network monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities, particularly those involving dynamic DNS and known malware signatures.

3. **User Education**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate users about phishing attacks, the dangers of opening unknown files, and the importance of security hygiene.

4. **Endpoint Security**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions that can detect and block fileless malware and other sophisticated threats.

5. **Incident Response**: Develop and regularly update incident response plans to ensure quick and effective action in the event of a security breach.

By following these recommendations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of exploitation by threat actors.
