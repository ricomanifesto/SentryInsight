# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape is dominated by a wave of high-impact, remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that attackers are weaponizing within days—sometimes hours—of public disclosure. Active campaigns are abusing new flaws in Wing FTP Server and Citrix NetScaler (“Citrix Bleed 2”), while proof-of-concept exploits for Fortinet FortiWeb are accelerating in-the-wild exploitation. Simultaneously, supply-chain attacks (WordPress Gravity Forms, OpenVSX) and hardware-level assaults such as the GPUHammer RowHammer variant underscore the breadth of vectors now available to adversaries. Bluetooth (“PerfektBlue”) and mobile eSIM weaknesses further expand the attack surface across automotive, industrial, and consumer environments. Ransomware operators (notably Pay2Key) and data-theft groups continue to leverage these vulnerabilities to maximize impact against Western targets.

- **Status**: Demonstrated exploit; NVIDIA urges enabling system-level ECC and upcoming firmware mitigations.

### “PerfektBlue” Bluetooth RCE Chain
- **Description**: Four flaws in OpenSynergy BlueSDK allow a one-click or proximity-based attacker to overflow heap structures and run code over Bluetooth.
- **Impact**: Remote hijack of infotainment units, ECUs, medical devices, and industrial controllers using BlueSDK.
- **Status**: No official patches yet for many OEM implementations; active weaponization observed in automotive penetration tests.

### Laravel APP_KEY Exposure to RCE
- **Description**: Leaked APP_KEY values on public GitHub repositories let attackers forge encrypted cookies and trigger unserialize() payloads.
- **Impact**: Remote command execution on over 600 internet-facing Laravel applications.
- **Status**: Mass scanning and exploitation underway; admins must rotate APP_KEYs and invalidate sessions.

### WordPress Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: Compromise of the developer’s infrastructure injected a PHP backdoor into manual installer ZIPs downloaded from the official site.
- **Impact**: Site defacement, credential theft, arbitrary code execution on tens of thousands of WordPress sites.
- **Status**: Backdoored packages pulled; users instructed to verify hashes and reinstall.

### OpenVSX Extension Repository Zero-Day
- **Description**: Path-traversal logic flaw allowed attackers to overwrite any extension and execute malicious code upon installation in Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code forks.
- **Impact**: Potential compromise of millions of developer workstations through poisoned extensions.
- **Status**: Zero-day patched; no further exploitation reported post-fix.

### eSIM Oracle Stack Vulnerability
- **Description**: Legacy Oracle SIM Toolkit bug still present in eSIM management software permits remote profile cloning and device takeover.
- **Impact**: Covert spying, call/SMS interception, full SIM profile manipulation.
- **Status**: Exploitation observed in targeted surveillance campaigns; several vendors issuing firmware updates.

### McHire Chatbot Weak Credential Exposure
- **Description**: Production database protected by the password “123456” exposed 64 million job-application chat logs.
- **Impact**: Leakage of PII, employment history, and contact details of US job applicants.
- **Status**: Database secured post-discovery; data likely already scraped.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Heap/Buffer Overflow (RCE)**: Crafted Zlib packets against Wing FTP Server trigger code execution.
- **Memory-Scraping Token Theft**: Citrix Bleed 2 extracts session tokens via repeated HTTP requests.
- **SQL Injection → OS Command**: Malicious HTTP parameters in FortiWeb API escalate from DB control to shell.
- **RowHammer on GDDR6 (“GPUHammer”)**: High-frequency memory row toggling flips bits affecting GPU memory integrity.
- **Bluetooth 1-Click RCE (“PerfektBlue”)**: Malformed A2DP metadata packet over classic Bluetooth triggers heap overflow.
- **Cookie Forgery / Unserialize Gadget**: Laravel APP_KEY leak enables attacker-controlled serialized payload injection.
- **Supply-Chain Backdoor Implantation**: Compromised Gravity Forms ZIP distributes obfuscated PHP webshells.
- **Extension Overwrite (OpenVSX)**: Path traversal replaces legitimate .vsix packages with malicious versions.
- **SIM Profile Cloning**: Remote SMS containing crafted SIM Toolkit commands alters eSIM profiles.
- **Credential Stuffing on Exposed DB**: Weak hard-coded password grants full unauthenticated access to McHire data store.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unnamed Cluster (Wing FTP Exploits)**: Mass-scanning the internet, dropping reverse shells; opportunistic intrusions across SMBs.
- **Iranian-Aligned Pay2Key**: Incentivizing affiliates with 80 % profit share to leverage Citrix Bleed 2 and FortiWeb bugs against US and Israeli targets.
- **Scattered Spider (Arrests Reported)**: Historically used supply-chain and SQLi routes; recent UK arrests may reduce activity temporarily.
- **Automotive Security Researchers**: Demonstrated “PerfektBlue” exploits at DEF CON; PoC code leaked to underground forums.
- **State-Sponsored Surveillance Groups**: Exploiting eSIM Oracle flaw for mobile espionage in EMEA and APAC regions.
- **Malware Distributors**: Leveraging backdoored Gravity Forms to inject SEO spam and credential-stealing scripts into WordPress sites.
