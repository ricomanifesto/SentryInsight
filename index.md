# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape reveals significant exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors, with state-sponsored groups leading sophisticated campaigns targeting cloud infrastructure and endpoint devices. The Chinese APT group Murky Panda (Silk Typhoon) is conducting advanced supply chain attacks through cloud environments, while APT36 has developed new Linux-based attack techniques using desktop files. Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in targeted attacks, and new malware families are emerging with advanced evasion capabilities. Hardware vulnerabilities in widely-deployed systems are exposing millions of devices to potential compromise, while social engineering attacks continue to evolve with more sophisticated deception techniques.
