# Exploitation Report

Recent security articles highlight critical exploitation activities, particularly focusing on zero-day vulnerabilities and actively exploited flaws. Notably, Microsoft has patched a zero-day vulnerability in WebDAV that was under active exploitation, alongside a new Secure Boot flaw that allows attackers to install bootkit malware. Additionally, Mirai botnets have been reported exploiting vulnerabilities in the Wazuh security platform, showcasing the rapid exploitation of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Furthermore, coordinated brute-force attacks targeting Apache Tomcat management panels have been observed, indicating a rise in automated attack strategies.

## Active Exploitation Details

### WebDAV Zero-Day
- **Description**: A vulnerability in the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol that allows unauthorized access and manipulation of web resources.
- **Impact**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and potentially execute arbitrary code on affected systems.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; patches have been released by Microsoft.
- **CVE ID**: Not explicitly mentioned in the articles.

### Secure Boot Flaw
- **Description**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass Secure Boot protections, enabling the installation of bootkit malware on affected systems.
- **Impact**: Successful exploitation can lead to persistent malware installation, compromising the integrity of the operating system and allowing further attacks.
- **Status**: Actively exploited; a patch has been released.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-3052

### Wazuh Security Platform Vulnerability
- **Description**: A flaw in the Wazuh security platform that has been exploited by Mirai botnets.
- **Impact**: This vulnerability allows botnets to compromise the security platform, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over connected devices.
- **Status**: Actively exploited; details on patch availability were not specified.
- **CVE ID**: Not explicitly mentioned in the articles.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Windows**: Various versions affected by the WebDAV and Secure Boot vulnerabilities.
- **Wazuh Security Platform**: Specific versions of the Wazuh platform are vulnerable to exploitation by botnets.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Management panels exposed online are targeted by brute-force attacks.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Brute-Force Attacks**: Coordinated attacks targeting Apache Tomcat management interfaces using hundreds of unique IP addresses to gain unauthorized access.
- **Bootkit Installation**: Exploitation of the Secure Boot flaw allows attackers to install persistent malware that can evade traditional security measures.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Mirai Botnets**: Actively exploiting vulnerabilities in the Wazuh security platform to expand their control over compromised devices.
- **Stealth Falcon APT**: Exploiting Microsoft RCE zero-day vulnerabilities in the Middle East, indicating targeted attacks against specific organizations or sectors.
- **Coordinated Brute-Force Campaigns**: A large-scale operation involving numerous malicious IPs targeting Apache Tomcat management panels, demonstrating a shift towards automated attack methodologies.
