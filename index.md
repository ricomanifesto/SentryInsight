# Exploitation Report

Over the last week, defenders observed a notable uptick in supply-chain and virtualization-layer attacks.  A compromised Amazon-signed Visual Studio Code extension was weaponized to issue destructive data-wiping commands, while the China-nexus “Fire Ant” group breached isolated VMware infrastructures to pivot into supposedly air-gapped environments.  At the same time, the AI-generated “Koske” malware is automatically exploiting exposed Linux services to deploy a new cryptocurrency-mining botnet, and the Patchwork APT is sending weaponized LNK files to Turkish defense firms.  Each of these campaigns is underway now, with in-the-wild exploitation confirmed by incident responders and security researchers.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Compromised “Q Developer Extension for VS Code”
- **Description**: A trojanized build of Amazon’s generative-AI coding assistant extension was uploaded to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.  The malicious update appended additional JavaScript routines that issued `rm -rf /*`-style commands, leading to full data erasure on developer workstations.
- **Impact**: Local source-code destruction, loss of intellectual property, potential leakage of AWS credentials stored in environment variables, and downstream supply-chain risk to any projects compiled on the infected hosts.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; Amazon has pulled the rogue package and released a clean, cryptographically signed version.  Users must reinstall and audit systems for unauthorized file deletion.
  
### VMware Silo-Bypass Exploitation (“Fire Ant” Campaign)
- **Description**: The “Fire Ant” threat group compromised vCenter, ESXi hosts, and VMware Horizon environments by chaining virtualization-layer flaws with credential theft and host manipulation utilities (e.g., VirtualPITA, VirtualPie, and VirtualPKG).  The tooling allowed direct interaction with guest VMs on networks that were otherwise segmented from the attackers.
- **Impact**: Full guest-to-host compromise, lateral movement into isolated production networks, credential dumping, persistent hypervisor-level backdoors, and data exfiltration.
- **Status**: Confirmed active exploitation.  VMware has released patches and hardening guidance; organizations that have postponed hypervisor patching remain exposed.
  
### “Koske” AI-Generated Linux Malware
- **Description**: “Koske” is an autonomously evolved Bash/Go miner that leverages large-language-model generated code blocks.  It scans for and exploits weak SSH credentials, outdated CMS plug-ins, and misconfigured Redis instances to obtain initial access, then deploys an XMRig-based mining payload.
- **Impact**: CPU exhaustion, elevated cloud spend, and potential foothold for secondary attackers via the malware’s built-in reverse shell module.
- **Status**: Actively propagating; no vendor patch applicable—mitigation requires credential hardening and service lockdown.
  
### Malicious LNK Spear-Phishing (Patchwork → Turkish Defense Contractors)
- **Description**: Patchwork APT is dispatching phishing e-mails containing weaponized Windows shortcut (LNK) files that launch PowerShell stagers, ultimately delivering a custom RAT for reconnaissance and document theft.
- **Impact**: Remote command execution under user context, credential harvesting, and exfiltration of sensitive R&D data related to Turkish defense programs.
- **Status**: Ongoing campaign; Microsoft Defender and other AV engines now detect the latest samples, but no single vendor patch applies—user awareness and attachment filtering are required.
  
### “EAGLET” Backdoor in Operation Caravel
- **Description**: A new espionage wave against Russian aerospace entities drops the “EAGLET” DLL backdoor via malicious ISO installers shared on engineering‐forum file exchanges.
- **Impact**: Persistent system-level access, automated screenshot capture, and bulk document exfiltration over HTTPS.
- **Status**: Active; security researchers published IoCs and YARA rules.  Victims must hunt for rogue persistence entries and replace compromised hosts.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Amazon Q Developer Extension for VS Code**: Versions pulled from the marketplace between 02 Jul – 05 Jul 2025  
  • **Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux workstations running Visual Studio Code

- **VMware ESXi / vCenter / Horizon**: Unpatched 7.x & 8.x builds most frequently abused  
  • **Platform**: On-prem datacenters and co-located private-cloud environments

- **Linux servers running SSH, Redis, WordPress, or outdated CMS plug-ins**

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Supply-Chain Package Poisoning**  
  • **Vector**: Upload of a tampered VS Code extension to the official marketplace

- **Hypervisor Escape & Lateral Movement**  
  • **Vector**: Exploitation of VMware management interfaces, followed by tool-based VM manipulation

- **Automated Internet-Wide Scanning & Weak-Credential Exploitation**  
  • **Vector**: “Koske” scans for TCP 22, 6379, 8080, etc., then brute-forces or abuses default creds
