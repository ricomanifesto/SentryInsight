# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple vendor products, with Cisco IOS systems, Pandoc utilities, Libraesva Email Security Gateways, and SonicWall SMA appliances under active attack. State-sponsored threat actors, particularly Chinese groups like RedNovember and UNC5221, are conducting sophisticated espionage campaigns using advanced malware including BRICKSTORM backdoors and Pantegana. Meanwhile, cybercriminals are leveraging ransomware variants like Obscura and RTX to disrupt operations, with one arrest made in connection to airport disruptions. The exploitation landscape also includes supply chain attacks through malicious NPM packages using steganographic techniques and phishing campaigns targeting high-value platforms like GitHub and PyPI.
