# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp's iOS and macOS applications that has been actively exploited in targeted attacks, multiple security flaws in the Sitecore Experience Platform that could lead to remote code execution, and the distribution of the TamperedChef infostealer through fraudulent PDF editing applications. Additionally, threat actors are leveraging legitimate forensic tools like Velociraptor to establish command and control channels using Visual Studio Code for tunneling operations.
