# Exploitation Report

Over the last week, defenders observed a sharp uptick in real-world attacks leveraging critical remote-code-execution and privilege-escalation flaws across network infrastructure, developer tooling, macOS endpoints, and print-management servers. The most pressing threat is the publication of a full exploit chain for Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) that allows unauthenticated takeover (CVE-2025-20281). Concurrently, CISA warns that PaperCut NG/MF servers continue to be compromised through a high-severity RCE bug, while Google has patched a Gemini CLI flaw abused to run stealth commands on developers’ machines. On Apple platforms, Microsoft researchers detailed “Sploitlight,” a vulnerability that bypasses TCC protections to siphon sensitive Apple Intelligence data. These vulnerabilities are being folded into active campaigns ranging from ransomware operations to software-supply-chain attacks, underscoring the importance of rapid patching and layered defenses.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Unauthenticated RCE
- **Description**: A deserialization flaw in the web-service interface lets remote, unauthenticated attackers create administrative accounts and execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact**: Full system compromise, lateral movement into network authentication infrastructure, and potential credential harvesting.
- **Status**: Public exploit chain released; Cisco has issued fixed builds and work-arounds.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-20281

### PaperCut NG/MF Remote Code Execution via CSRF
- **Description**: Abuse of the printer-management server’s web interface through cross-site request forgery enables attackers to run arbitrary commands under the PaperCut service account.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on print servers, privilege escalation, and footholds for ransomware deployment.
- **Status**: Added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog; patches available from the vendor.

### Google Gemini CLI Stealth Command-Execution Flaw
- **Description**: Malicious prompts or project files can trick Gemini CLI into invoking allow-listed system utilities (e.g., `bash`, `curl`) without user awareness.
- **Impact**: Silent data exfiltration, implant installation, and compromise of development workstations.
- **Status**: Patched in the latest Gemini CLI release; exploitation evidence observed in the wild.

### macOS “Sploitlight” TCC Bypass
- **Description**: Manipulates Spotlight metadata-indexing to circumvent Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) checks, granting unauthorized access to private files—including Apple Intelligence caches.
- **Impact**: Theft of sensitive user data, privacy violations, and potential persistence mechanisms.
- **Status**: Fixed in recent macOS security updates; attacks rely on users running outdated Sonoma/Ventura builds.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) < 3.5**  
  Platform: Network access-control appliances (hardware and virtual)

- **PaperCut NG/MF 20.x–24.x (unpatched)**  
  Platform: Windows, Linux, and macOS print-management servers

- **Google Gemini CLI ≤ 2025.06**  
  Platform: Developer workstations on Windows, macOS, and Linux

- **macOS Sonoma & Ventura (pre-July 2025 security patch levels)**  
  Platform: Apple desktops and laptops running Spotlight

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Unauthenticated Deserialization Attack (Cisco ISE)**  
  Vector: Direct HTTP(S) requests to the default administration port craft malicious serialized objects to trigger RCE.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery to RCE (PaperCut)**  
  Vector: Victim administrators browse to attacker-controlled pages that submit unauthorized admin actions to the PaperCut server.

- **Prompt Injection / Command Proxying (Gemini CLI)**  
  Vector: Malicious code snippets/prompt files cause the AI assistant to run system-level commands via allow-listed binaries.

- **Spotlight Metadata Tampering (macOS Sploitlight)**  
  Vector: Crafted `.mdimporter` bundles or manipulated metadata force Spotlight to read arbitrary files, bypassing TCC.

- **Software-Supply-Chain Implantation (Endgame Gear & Toptal incidents)**  
  Vector: Compromised official downloads or npm packages deliver malware without exploiting local vulnerabilities.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Chaos Ransomware (ex-BlackSuit members)**  
  Campaign: Leveraging PaperCut and Cisco ISE footholds for double-extortion attacks against education and healthcare networks.

- **Unknown Supply-Chain Actor – Endgame Gear Incident**  
  Campaign: Injected malware into OP1w mouse configuration tool, distributing trojanized binaries between 26 June–9 July 2025.

- **Unknown Threat Actor – Toptal GitHub Breach**  
  Campaign: Published ten malicious npm packages (≈5 000 downloads) to harvest developer credentials and open backdoors.

- **APT-style Operators Exploiting Sploitlight**  
  Campaign: Targeting macOS users in tech and media sectors to harvest Apple Intelligence data and authentication tokens.

Maintaining up-to-date patch levels on network appliances, developer tools, and macOS endpoints, combined with strict code-signing validation and Zero Trust segmentation, remains critical to disrupting these exploitation chains.
