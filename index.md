# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape continues to face severe threats from sophisticated threat actors exploiting critical vulnerabilities across multiple platforms. Most notably, the Clop ransomware gang has been actively exploiting an Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day vulnerability since early August, while the Storm-1175 threat group has leveraged a critical Fortra GoAnywhere flaw to deploy Medusa ransomware. Additionally, a maximum severity Redis vulnerability and a Zimbra zero-day have been weaponized in targeted attacks. These incidents highlight the persistent threat from both established ransomware groups and state-sponsored actors, with North Korean hackers alone stealing over $2 billion in cryptocurrency this year through various exploitation techniques.
