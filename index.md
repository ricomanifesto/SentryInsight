# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security concerns across multiple domains. Most notably, Commvault systems face severe pre-authentication vulnerabilities that could enable remote code execution attacks, while AI-powered systems like Perplexity's Comet browser are susceptible to prompt injection attacks that could expose user data. Additionally, threat actors continue to leverage legitimate infrastructure for malicious purposes, with the Scattered Spider collective facing legal consequences for their high-profile cyberattacks, and ransomware groups like Warlock actively targeting telecommunications companies.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Commvault Pre-Authentication Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Four security gaps in Commvault systems that can be chained together to achieve remote code execution without authentication
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable Commvault instances, potentially leading to complete system compromise
- **Status**: Commvault has released security updates to address these vulnerabilities

### Perplexity Comet AI Browser Prompt Injection
- **Description**: Vulnerability in Perplexity's Comet AI browser that allows attackers to inject malicious commands through prompt manipulation
- **Impact**: Attackers can potentially gain access to users' personal data by embedding malicious commands within legitimate prompts
- **Status**: Actively exploitable vulnerability identified by Brave security researchers

### ChatGPT Downgrade Attack
- **Description**: Attack technique that uses brief, plain clues in prompts to force ChatGPT to query older, less secure models
- **Impact**: Attackers can bypass security measures in newer GPT models by forcing the system to use older versions with weaker protections
- **Status**: Currently exploitable attack vector that undermines GPT-5 security measures

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Commvault Systems**: Multiple versions affected by pre-authentication exploit chains enabling remote code execution
- **Perplexity Comet AI Browser**: Vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that could expose user data
- **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Susceptible to downgrade attacks that bypass newer security features
- **EV Smart Charging Infrastructure**: ISO 15118 standard implementations pose potential cyber-risks for vehicle-to-grid communications
- **Colt Technology Services**: Customer data compromised in ransomware attack
- **Windows Networks**: Targeted by insider threats using custom malware with kill switches

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Pre-Authentication Exploit Chaining**: Multiple vulnerabilities combined to achieve remote code execution without authentication credentials
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious commands embedded within legitimate AI prompts to manipulate system behavior
- **Model Downgrade Attacks**: Forcing AI systems to use older, less secure models through carefully crafted prompts
- **VPS Infrastructure Abuse**: Threat actors leveraging legitimate virtual private server services for stealth and speed in malicious operations
- **Insider Sabotage**: Custom malware deployment with kill switches to disrupt former employer operations
- **Ransomware Data Auctions**: Stolen data being actively auctioned by ransomware groups

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Scattered Spider Collective**: High-profile cyberattack group with member Noah Michael Urban sentenced to 10 years in prison for various cybercrimes
- **Warlock Ransomware Gang**: Actively auctioning stolen customer data from Colt Technology Services telecommunications company
- **Insider Threats**: Software developer sentenced to 4 years for creating kill switches and sabotaging ex-employer's Windows network systems
- **VPS Abusers**: Threat actors increasingly using legitimate virtual private server infrastructure to establish malicious operations quickly and quietly
