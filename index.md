# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape shows significant active exploitation across multiple attack vectors, with particular concern around Android malware campaigns, infrastructure compromises, and advanced persistent threat activities. Notable exploitation includes the Klopatra Android banking trojan compromising over 3,000 devices through VNC remote access capabilities, widespread abuse of Milesight industrial cellular routers for SMS phishing campaigns targeting European users since February 2022, and sophisticated attacks leveraging Oracle E-Business Suite vulnerabilities by the Clop ransomware group. Critical vulnerabilities in enterprise infrastructure include flaws in Red Hat OpenShift AI enabling full infrastructure takeover and OneLogin IAM solutions exposing OIDC secrets for application impersonation attacks.
