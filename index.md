# Exploitation Report

During the first week of June 2025, several high-profile intrusions and malware campaigns demonstrated that attackers are widening their toolsets beyond traditional software flaws.  Retail, insurance, telecom, cryptocurrency, and developer ecosystems all saw active exploitation — ranging from Scattered Spider’s high-impact credential-theft operations against Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Aflac, to nation-state attacks attributed to Salt Typhoon and Lazarus.  At the same time, large-scale supply-chain abuse on GitHub and sophisticated Android malware (Godfather and AntiDot) revealed new techniques that bypass platform security controls through virtualization and overlay abuse.  Although few CVE-enumerated bugs were named in the reporting period, every incident involved a clearly defined vulnerability — whether in identity infrastructure, cloud wallets, mobile operating-system controls, or software-distribution trust models — and all are confirmed as being exploited in the wild right now.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Scattered Spider Identity & Access Exploitation
- **Description**: Multi-stage credential-theft and social-engineering campaign against U.K. retailers (Marks & Spencer, Co-op) and U.S. insurers (Aflac).  Tactics include SIM-swapping, help-desk phishing, and session-token hijacking to seize Okta/SSO accounts and cloud workloads.  
- **Impact**: Up to $592 million in combined damages; theft of personal data, operational disruption, and follow-on BEC fraud.  
- **Status**: Ongoing; no single vendor patch because exploitation relies on human-layer weaknesses and misconfigured identity platforms.  Victims are hardening MFA and rotating tokens.

### Malicious Copycat GitHub Repositories
- **Description**: Dozens of fake open-source projects are posted to GitHub that masquerade as popular packages but contain backdoors or info-stealers executed during build time.  
- **Impact**: Remote code execution on developer workstations and CI/CD runners, leading to supply-chain compromise of downstream applications.  
- **Status**: Active takedown in progress by GitHub; new repos continue to appear, indicating active adversary agility.

### Trojanized GitHub Repositories Campaign (200+ Repos)
- **Description**: Separate but parallel campaign uncovered by researchers showing more than 200 trojanized Python “hacking tool” repositories that drop obfuscated RATs and cryptocurrency stealers.  
- **Impact**: Full system takeover of gamers and security-research enthusiasts who clone or install the scripts; credential and wallet theft.  
- **Status**: Active; indicators published but malicious projects still live or being re-posted.

### Godfather Android Virtualization Abuse
- **Description**: New Godfather malware builds isolated virtual environments on an infected phone, sideloads legitimate banking apps, and intercepts credentials and transactions.  
- **Impact**: Real-time hijack of banking sessions, unauthorized transfers, and credential harvesting without raising device security alerts.  
- **Status**: In-the-wild infections confirmed across multiple regions; Google Play Protect updates released, but side-loading vectors remain unpatched.

### AntiDot Android Overlay & NFC Theft
- **Description**: Android banking malware that combines overlay attacks, virtualization, and near-field communication (NFC) misuse to steal payment data and OTP codes.  
- **Impact**: Compromises more than 3,775 devices in 273 campaigns; enables card-present fraud and unauthorized contactless payments.  
- **Status**: Active; mitigation guidance released by researchers—users must patch, disable side-loading, and revoke Accessibility permissions.

### Salt Typhoon (APT) Cloud Intrusion into Viasat
- **Description**: State-sponsored group gains foothold in Viasat’s environment using stolen cloud credentials and living-off-the-land techniques.  
- **Impact**: Potential intelligence exfiltration; no service interruption reported but demonstrates vulnerability of satellite telecom infrastructure.  
- **Status**: Investigation ongoing; incident shared with government partners, hardening measures applied.

### Lazarus Group Exchange-Wallet Exploitation (BitoPro)
- **Description**: Attackers linked to Lazarus used spear-phishing and exploited weak internal wallet controls to siphon $11 million from BitoPro on May 8 2025.  
- **Impact**: Direct crypto theft and reputational damage; risk of follow-on laundering through mixing services.  
- **Status**: Funds in transit; exchange coordinating with law enforcement and blockchain-analysis firms to track assets.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Marks & Spencer / Co-op Retail Infrastructure**  
  - **Platform**: Cloud IAM (Okta/SSO), POS back-office systems

- **Aflac Insurance Systems**  
  - **Platform**: Corporate VPN, SaaS productivity and claims portals

- **GitHub Ecosystem**  
  - **Platform**: All developer OSes that clone malicious repos; CI/CD runners

- **Android Devices (Godfather & AntiDot)**  
  - **Platform**: Android 10–14 phones permitting side-loading or with Accessibility Service enabled

- **Viasat Corporate Network & Satellite Operations**  
  - **Platform**: Azure/AWS cloud tenants, on-premise identity infrastructure

- **BitoPro Cryptocurrency Exchange**  
  - **Platform**: Hot-wallet management servers, internal trading APIs

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **SIM-Swapping & MFA Fatigue**  
  - **Vector**: Socially engineered carrier account changes and push-notification spamming to bypass MFA for Scattered Spider campaigns

- **Malicious Repository Cloning**  
  - **Vector**: Developers execute setup scripts from trojanized GitHub projects, granting attackers RCE

- **Virtualization Hijack on Android**  
  - **Vector**: Malware creates isolated VM/container to run genuine banking apps while intercepting traffic invisibly

- **Overlay Attacks & Accessibility Abuse**  
  - **Vector**: Fake screens layered over legitimate banking apps to steal credentials and OTPs

- **Hot-Wallet API Abuse**  
  - **Vector**: Insider access or stolen keys used by Lazarus to sign unauthorized crypto transactions

- **Living-off-the-Land Cloud Techniques**  
  - **Vector**: Salt Typhoon uses existing Azure/AWS CLI tools and stolen tokens to evade detection

## Threat Actor Activities
