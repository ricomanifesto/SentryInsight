# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently focused on Android devices and enterprise infrastructure, with Google addressing 120 security flaws in its September 2025 Android security update, including two zero-day vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in the wild. Threat actors are also leveraging AI-powered tools like HexStrike AI to rapidly exploit newly disclosed Citrix vulnerabilities, demonstrating an accelerated timeline from disclosure to active exploitation. Additionally, Iranian threat actors have compromised over 100 embassy email accounts through sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns targeting diplomatic missions globally.
