# Exploitation Report

Current exploitation activity reveals several critical security incidents targeting enterprise infrastructure and supply chain systems. State-sponsored threat actors have been actively exploiting vulnerabilities in email security gateways and GeoServer instances, while malicious campaigns are leveraging compromised cloud infrastructure for large-scale attacks. Notable incidents include the exploitation of Libraesva Email Security Gateway by state hackers, federal agency breaches through unpatched GeoServer instances, and sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting the npm ecosystem. Additionally, cybercriminals are deploying advanced malware through SEO poisoning campaigns and leveraging misconfigured Docker containers for DDoS-as-a-service operations.
