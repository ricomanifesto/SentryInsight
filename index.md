# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway, including sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting developer infrastructure and ongoing cyber espionage campaigns. The most significant threats include the GhostAction GitHub supply chain attack that compromised over 3,000 secrets, a massive JavaScript package compromise affecting billions of weekly downloads, and the continued activities of the Salt Typhoon threat group with newly discovered infrastructure dating back to 2020. Additionally, multiple data breaches have been reported across various platforms, while threat actors are deploying advanced malware tools designed to evade security detection systems.

## Active Exploitation Details

### GhostAction GitHub Supply Chain Attack
- **Description**: A sophisticated supply chain attack targeting GitHub repositories that successfully compromised developer secrets and authentication tokens
- **Impact**: Attackers gained access to 3,325 secrets including PyPI, npm, DockerHub, GitHub tokens, Cloudflare, and AWS keys, potentially enabling widespread secondary attacks
- **Status**: Attack has been identified and is being actively investigated; affected organizations are being notified

### JavaScript Package Compromise
- **Description**: At least 18 popular JavaScript code packages were compromised with malicious software designed to steal cryptocurrency
- **Impact**: These packages are collectively downloaded more than two billion times each week, creating massive potential for widespread compromise
- **Status**: The compromised packages were briefly active before being detected and remediated

### Salesloft GitHub Account Compromise
- **Description**: A breach initiated through GitHub account compromise that escalated into a massive supply chain attack
