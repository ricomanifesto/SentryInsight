# Exploitation Report

Recent weeks have seen an uptick in high-impact exploitation across consumer AI services, critical infrastructure software, and low-level firmware. Threat actors are actively abusing a critical remote-code-execution flaw in Wing FTP Server, chaining prompt-injection bugs in Google’s Gemini AI features for phishing, and weaponizing weaknesses in Gigabyte UEFI firmware to deploy stealthy bootkits that bypass Secure Boot. New attack surfaces are also emerging: a RowHammer offshoot (“GPUHammer”) targeting NVIDIA GPUs, an eSIM design flaw that jeopardizes billions of IoT devices, and large-scale key-leak abuse in Laravel applications. Government-sponsored groups are simultaneously experimenting with novel delivery tactics such as AWS Lambda (HazyBeacon) and npm supply-chain poisoning (XORIndex), underscoring the widening gap between patch availability and real-world remediation.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Wing FTP Server Remote-Code-Execution Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical flaw in the Wing FTP Server web interface permits unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host.
- **Impact**: Full system compromise, data theft, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment.
- **Status**: Public exploit code released; in-the-wild exploitation observed less than 24 hours after disclosure. Vendor hot-fix released.

### Google Gemini Prompt-Injection Vulnerability (Invisible Prompts)
- **Description**: Manipulation of hidden or whitespace-formatted text causes Gemini to execute attacker-supplied instructions while appearing benign to the user.
- **Impact**: Phishing redirections, session hijacking, and delivery of malicious links under the guise of Google Security alerts.
- **Status**: Actively abused in the wild; mitigations rolling out across Workspace.

### Google Gemini Email-Summary Hijacking Bug
- **Description**: Gemini’s auto-generated email summaries can be coerced into embedding malicious warnings or instructions that lure users to phishing sites.
- **Impact**: Credential harvesting and drive-by malware delivery without traditional attachments or URLs in the original email.
- **Status**: Google acknowledged issue and is implementing server-side filters; exploitation ongoing.

### Gigabyte UEFI Firmware Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Multiple flaws in Gigabyte motherboard firmware allow unsigned code to be written to SPI flash, planting bootkits that persist below the OS and bypass Secure Boot.
- **Impact**: Stealth persistence, OS-agnostic malware deployment, and difficulty in forensic detection.
- **Status**: Firmware updates available for dozens of models; exploitation confirmed in incident-response engagements.

### eSIM Weakness in Kigen eUICC Cards
- **Description**: Logic flaws in Kigen’s remote profile management let attackers clone, swap, or de-provision eSIM profiles over-the-air.
- **Impact**: Device hijack, large-scale denial of service to IoT fleets, SIM-based man-in-the-middle interception.
- **Status**: Proof-of-concept attacks demonstrated; active exploitation reported against smart-meter networks. Patches under coordinated release with carriers.

### GPUHammer (RowHammer Variant on NVIDIA GPUs)
- **Description**: Bit-flip fault-injection against GPU DRAM undermines AI model integrity and can escalate to host memory corruption on shared-memory workloads.
- **Impact**: Model poisoning, data leakage from GPU to CPU space, and potential privilege escalation in multi-tenant environments.
- **Status**: Demonstrated by researchers; NVIDIA urges enabling ECC globally. No firmware fix yet; exploitation feasibility rated high for cloud GPU instances.

### Laravel APP_KEY Exposure Leading to RCE
- **Description**: Thousands of public GitHub repos leak APP_KEY secrets, letting attackers craft encrypted payloads that the application trusts and executes.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, database exfiltration, and supply-chain lateral attacks.
- **Status**: Mass-scanning attacks observed; maintainers advised to rotate keys and deploy patches.

### McHire Chatbot Weak Credential Vulnerability
- **Description**: Hard-coded password “123456” on a backend service exposed chat logs for 64 million McDonald’s job applicants.
- **Impact**: Leakage of PII, employment history, and social-engineering fodder.
- **Status**: Credentials rotated; data already exfiltrated before fix.

  **Platform**: Windows, Linux, cloud GPU instances  
- **Laravel Web Applications**: Framework v8/v9 with leaked APP_KEYs  
  **Platform**: PHP / Apache / Nginx  
- **McHire Chatbot Platform**: Backend services handling applicant chats  
  **Platform**: Cloud-hosted web application

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Unauthenticated Web RCE**: Direct HTTP requests exploit input-validation flaws (Wing FTP Server).  
- **Prompt Injection via Invisible Formatting**: Zero-width or HTML-hidden text manipulates AI output (Google Gemini).  
- **Auto-Summary Manipulation**: Abuse of AI summarization feature to embed malicious instructions (Google Gemini).  
- **UEFI Bootkit Deployment**: Flashing malicious firmware image through vendor update mechanism (Gigabyte).  
- **Remote SIM Profile Manipulation**: Over-the-air eUICC management commands abused for takeover (Kigen eSIM).  
- **RowHammer-Style Bit Flips**: Repeated GPU DRAM access induces memory corruption (GPUHammer).  
- **Cryptographic Key Forgery**: Using leaked Laravel APP_KEY to sign malicious payloads that pass integrity checks.  
- **Hard-Coded Credentials**: Static passwords grant unauthorized API access (McHire).
