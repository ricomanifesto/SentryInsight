# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats demonstrate a significant shift toward sophisticated supply chain attacks and novel malware delivery mechanisms. Chinese state-sponsored groups are exploiting cloud trust relationships to compromise downstream customers, while cybercriminals are leveraging deceptive tools and social engineering tactics to deploy credential-stealing malware. Notable activities include the distribution of malicious Go modules disguised as legitimate SSH tools, exploitation of GeoServer vulnerabilities for botnet operations, and the emergence of new Linux-targeted malware using innovative evasion techniques. Critical hardware vulnerabilities in Dell laptops and novel attack vectors targeting both Windows and macOS systems highlight the expanding threat landscape across multiple platforms.
