# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape reveals multiple critical zero-day and active exploitation campaigns targeting enterprise infrastructure. Chinese threat actors are conducting sophisticated attacks against VMware environments using zero-day vulnerabilities since October 2024, while advanced persistent threat groups deploy fileless backdoors and memory-resident malware. Critical vulnerabilities in Cisco firewalls expose nearly 50,000 devices to active exploitation, and a critical Linux sudo flaw enables privilege escalation attacks. Banking trojans are employing AI-generated social engineering, while new toolkit frameworks convert PDFs into sophisticated phishing lures.

## Active Exploitation Details
