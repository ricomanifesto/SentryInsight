# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day exploitation activity has been identified with Apple releasing emergency security updates to address CVE-2025-43300, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability actively exploited in targeted attacks across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS platforms. Concurrently, Russian threat actors are conducting widespread attacks against thousands of end-of-life Cisco devices using a seven-year-old vulnerability, while cybercriminals increasingly abuse AI-powered website builders for malicious activities. The Scattered Spider cybercrime collective continues to demonstrate sophisticated attack capabilities through SIM swapping operations, and new ransomware variants are targeting vulnerable SharePoint servers in enterprise environments.
