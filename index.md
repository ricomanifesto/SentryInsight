# Exploitation Report

A diverse set of high-impact exploitation activity is unfolding across multiple sectors. Supply-chain abuse on GitHub, record-breaking DDoS traffic, and significant credential exposures are enabling broad opportunistic attacks, while tailored operations by well-resourced groups such as Salt Typhoon, Scattered Spider, Lazarus, and Qilin are driving sophisticated intrusions, ransomware deployments, and large-scale financial theft. Actively exploited weaknesses range from zero-day appliance flaws to social-engineering-driven identity compromise, illustrating that both technical and human layers remain prime targets. Continuous monitoring, rapid patching, and credential hygiene are critical as threat actors blend novel techniques with proven playbooks to maximize impact.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Massive Credential Exposure “Mother of All Breaches”
- **Description**: A compilation of approximately 16 billion previously stolen passwords aggregated into a single data set now circulating on dark-web forums.  
- **Impact**: Enables widespread credential-stuffing, account takeover, and secondary intrusions across any platform that relies on reused passwords.  
- **Status**: Data actively traded and leveraged in automated attacks; no patch possible—mitigation requires forced resets and MFA adoption.

### GitHub Copycat / Trojanized Repository Campaign
- **Description**: Attackers uploaded dozens of malicious look-alike repositories (200+ in the broader campaign) that masquerade as legitimate developer tools and game mods but deliver stealer or RAT payloads.  
- **Impact**: Developers integrating or forking these projects unwittingly execute attacker code, granting system access and potential supply-chain poisoning of downstream applications.  
- **Status**: Repositories reported and removed, but new clones appear continuously; developers urged to verify repository provenance and signatures.

### Salt Typhoon (China-linked) Zero-Day Appliance Intrusion
- **Description**: Salt Typhoon leveraged an undisclosed zero-day in a perimeter appliance used by telecom provider Viasat to gain initial foothold, followed by living-off-the-land techniques for long-term persistence.  
- **Impact**: Potential access to satellite network management environments, espionage, and disruption capabilities.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited; vendor working with government partners on remediation guidance and patches.

### Record-Breaking 7.3 Tbps DDoS (HTTP/2 Abuse)
- **Description**: Cloudflare mitigated a 7.3 Tbps distributed denial-of-service attack that abused a weakness in the HTTP/2 protocol “Rapid Reset” mechanism to amplify traffic.  
- **Impact**: Temporary takedown or severe latency for targeted hosting provider; illustrates capability to overwhelm even large cloud infrastructures.  
- **Status**: Technique actively weaponized in the wild; mitigation requires rate-limiting, protocol filtering, and vendor-level patches at reverse proxies / CDNs.

### Scattered Spider Identity-Centric Intrusions
- **Description**: Social-engineering and SIM-swapping tactics used to obtain privileged identity credentials, leading to breaches of Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and the insurance sector (Aflac incident).  
- **Impact**: Up to $592 million in operational disruption, data theft, and ransom demands.  
- **Status**: Ongoing campaign; organizations deploying out-of-band MFA and enhanced identity monitoring.

### Qilin Ransomware Affiliate Exploitation
- **Description**: Qilin RaaS affiliates breach victims through spear-phishing and vulnerable remote services, then deploy Golang-based lockers; new “Call Lawyer” feature threatens legal action to coerce payment.  
- **Impact**: Multi-extortion involving encryption, data leakage, and reputational damage.  
- **Status**: Actively targeting healthcare and manufacturing; no universal decryptor available.

### Lazarus Group Crypto-Exchange Compromise
- **Description**: North Korean Lazarus actors accessed Taiwanese exchange BitoPro’s hot-wallet infrastructure, stealing $11 million in digital assets. Initial access attributed to spear-phishing and exploitation of exchange back-end servers.  
- **Impact**: Direct financial loss and customer trust erosion; potential sanctions-evasion funding.  
- **Status**: Funds partially traced on-chain; exchange coordinating with international law enforcement.

### Android Malware Virtualization Exploits (Godfather & AntiDot)
- **Description**: New malware variants create isolated virtual environments on infected devices to bypass security controls and hijack banking apps via overlay attacks, NFC theft, and transaction manipulation.  
- **Impact**: Complete compromise of mobile banking sessions, credential theft, and unauthorized fund transfers.  
- **Status**: Campaigns still active; Google Play Protect updates rolling out, but sideloaded apps remain a risk.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Online Accounts (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc.)**  
  Platform: All internet-exposed authentication services leveraging traditional username/password schemes.

- **GitHub Developers & CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Platform: GitHub repositories, developer workstations, automated build systems.

- **Viasat Satellite Communications Infrastructure**  
  Platform: Network edge/appliance devices in satellite ground systems.

- **Hosting Providers & Web Services Using HTTP/2**  
  Platform: Any web infrastructure supporting HTTP/2, especially with insufficient request-rate controls.

- **Retail & Insurance Enterprises (M&S, Co-op, Aflac)**  
  Platform: Identity providers (SSO, MFA portals), call-center workflows.

- **Organizations Exposed to Qilin Ransomware**  
  Platform: Windows and Linux servers reachable over RDP, VPN, or unpatched public services.

- **Cryptocurrency Exchanges (BitoPro)**  
  Platform: Hot-wallet servers, internal trading platforms, employee endpoints.

- **Android Devices (Targets of Godfather/AntiDot)**  
  Platform: Android OS 10-14, especially devices allowing sideloaded APKs and developer mode.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Credential-Stuffing Automation**  
  Vector: Re-used passwords from 16 billion-entry breach compilation leveraged in large-scale login attempts.

- **Repository Impersonation & Dependency Confusion**  
  Vector: Malicious GitHub projects with names near-identical to popular tools trick developers into cloning.

- **Zero-Day Appliance Exploit & Living-off-the-Land**  
  Vector: Unpatched edge device flaw exploited remotely, followed by PowerShell/SSH lateral movement.

- **HTTP/2 “Rapid Reset” Flooding**  
  Vector: Crafting streams that are opened and immediately reset to amplify request rates.

- **SIM-Swapping & Deep Social Engineering**  
  Vector: Manipulating telecom providers and help desks to seize MFA tokens and Okta sessions.

- **Double-Extortion Ransomware Deployment**  
  Vector: Phishing e-mails deliver loaders; post-exploitation toolkit exfiltrates data before encryption.
