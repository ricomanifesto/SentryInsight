# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently targeting enterprise infrastructure through multiple vectors, with ransomware groups leading sophisticated campaigns against VPN solutions, supply chain attacks affecting major manufacturers, and nation-state actors deploying zero-day exploits. The Akira ransomware group is actively breaching SonicWall VPN devices despite multi-factor authentication protections, while threat actors have exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere with a maximum severity score. Additionally, Cisco ASA firewall zero-day exploits are being used to deploy advanced malware, and AI-powered phishing campaigns are successfully bypassing email security systems through obfuscated SVG files.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Fortra GoAnywhere Zero-Day Vulnerability
- **Description**: A maximum severity vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer software that was exploited in the wild
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise allowing unauthorized access to file transfer systems
- **Status**: Actively exploited as zero-day approximately one week before public disclosure; patches now available
- **CVE ID**: CVSS 10 severity rating (specific CVE not provided in articles)

### Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Exploits
- **Description**: Recently disclosed security flaws in Cisco ASA firewalls being exploited as zero-day attacks
- **Impact**: Deployment of RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware, providing persistent access to network infrastructure
- **Status**: Actively exploited in zero-day attacks; UK NCSC confirmed exploitation

### SonicWall VPN Vulnerability
- **Description**: Security flaw in SonicWall SSL VPN devices discovered last year, now being actively exploited by Akira ransomware
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to corporate networks even when MFA is enabled, leading to ransomware deployment
- **Status**: Active exploitation ongoing in broad ransomware campaign

## Affected Systems and Products
