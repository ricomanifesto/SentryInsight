# Exploitation Report

The October 2025 security landscape is dominated by Microsoft's massive Patch Tuesday release addressing 172-183 security flaws, including six actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. Critical exploitation activity spans multiple platforms, with Windows systems facing unprecedented risks from zero-days affecting every version ever shipped, while industrial control systems, Android devices, and enterprise software face targeted attacks. Notable threat actors including Chinese state-sponsored groups and the TigerJack cryptocurrency-stealing operation continue sophisticated campaigns, while new attack techniques like Pixnapping demonstrate evolving methods to bypass security controls and steal sensitive authentication data.
