# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals multiple critical vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild, with significant focus on enterprise infrastructure and cloud services. Most notably, attackers are leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research agent through the ShadowLeak attack, and exploiting a maximum-severity command injection flaw in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT systems. Nation-state actors, particularly from North Korea and Iran, continue sophisticated campaigns targeting telecommunications and cryptocurrency sectors through social engineering and malware deployment. Additionally, threat actors are exploiting recently patched Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities with custom malware kits, while a critical Microsoft Entra ID flaw that could have enabled complete tenant hijacking has been addressed before active exploitation.
