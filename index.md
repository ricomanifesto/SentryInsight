# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat landscape reveals significant exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors, with threat actors leveraging both known vulnerabilities and novel techniques. Notable campaigns include Chinese state-sponsored groups exploiting cloud trust relationships to compromise downstream customers, malicious Go modules masquerading as legitimate SSH tools to steal credentials, and sophisticated Linux malware campaigns using deceptive filenames to evade detection. Pakistani APT groups are actively targeting government entities with new Linux-based attack methods, while Mac users face emerging infostealer threats through fake troubleshooting guides.

## Active Exploitation Details

### GeoServer Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Multiple security vulnerabilities in GeoServer being actively exploited by cybercriminals
- **Impact**: Attackers can compromise GeoServer instances and use them for various malicious activities including launching further attacks
- **Status**: Known vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild

### Redis Server Exposures
- **Description**: Exposed Redis servers being targeted and compromised by multiple threat actor campaigns
