# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity landscape reveals critical exploitation activity across multiple fronts, with Google patching a sixth Chrome zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-10585) being actively exploited in attacks, representing a significant escalation in browser-targeted threats. Simultaneously, supply chain attacks continue to proliferate with malicious PyPI packages delivering the SilentSync RAT to Python developers, while threat actors exploit cloud services through compromised OAuth tokens to access massive datasets. Infrastructure breaches affecting SonicWall's MySonicWall service and ransomware attacks on major firms like Insight Partners demonstrate the persistent targeting of critical business systems. The convergence of AI-powered attack techniques, sophisticated phishing-as-a-service operations, and state-sponsored campaigns targeting economic policy experts indicates a rapidly evolving threat environment requiring immediate attention.
