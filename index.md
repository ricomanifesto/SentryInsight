# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild across multiple platforms and systems. The most significant threats include active exploitation of Pandoc CVE-2025-51591 targeting AWS EC2 instances to steal IAM credentials, state-sponsored attacks against Libraesva Email Security Gateway systems, and federal agencies being compromised through unpatched GeoServer instances. Additional concerning activity includes the emergence of the ShadowV2 botnet exploiting misconfigured Docker containers, ransomware attacks disrupting European airports, and multiple supply chain attacks targeting the npm ecosystem. Critical vulnerabilities in SolarWinds Web Help Desk (CVE-2025-26399) and Supermicro BMC firmware are also creating significant security risks for enterprise environments.
