# Exploitation Report

Over the past week, security researchers and government agencies have observed an uptick in high-impact exploitation activity targeting internet-facing infrastructure and widely deployed components. The most urgent threats include active remote-code-execution campaigns against Wing FTP Server (CVE-2025-47812), pre-authentication compromise of Citrix NetScaler appliances via the newly branded “Citrix Bleed 2” flaw (CVE-2025-5777), and weaponized SQL-injection leading to full takeover of Fortinet FortiWeb WAF instances (CVE-2025-25257). Supply-chain compromises (Gravity Forms), large-scale Bluetooth RCE (PerfektBlue), and novel hardware/AI attacks (GPUHammer) round out a rapidly evolving landscape, underscoring the need for immediate patching, rigorous configuration management, and continuous monitoring of emerging attack vectors.

- **Impact**: Remote control of infotainment systems, possible steering/safety functions depending on ECU integration.
- **Status**: Attack chain demonstrated; no vendor patch yet for many automotive platforms.

### Kigen eUICC eSIM Weakness
- **Description**: Logic flaws in Kigen’s eSIM profile management permit cloning or swapping of profiles, enabling SIM hijacking and device tracking.
- **Impact**: Voice/data interception, device impersonation, large-scale IoT disruption.
- **Status**: Technique verified on commercial cards; mitigations in development.

### GPUHammer RowHammer Variant
- **Description**: A new variant of RowHammer induces bit-flips in GDDR6 memory on NVIDIA GPUs, corrupting or degrading AI model integrity.
- **Impact**: Model poisoning, denial-of-service in AI workloads, potential elevation-of-privilege in shared-GPU environments.
- **Status**: Lab-grade exploit released; NVIDIA urges enabling ECC at the system level.

### Laravel APP_KEY Exposure
- **Description**: Thousands of GitHub repositories leaked production Laravel APP_KEY values, allowing attackers to craft signed payloads and trigger deserialization RCE.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution across more than 600 live web applications.
- **Status**: Mass-exploitation scripts circulating; developers must rotate keys and update environment variables.

### Google Gemini Workspace Prompt-Injection
- **Description**: Attackers craft specially formatted emails that force Gemini to append malicious links or instructions inside autogenerated summaries.
- **Impact**: Stealth phishing without traditional payloads, leading to credential theft.
- **Status**: Technique confirmed; Google reviewing mitigations.

### WordPress Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: The developer’s website delivered installer ZIPs containing an embedded PHP backdoor, giving attackers shell access on sites that performed manual updates.
- **Impact**: Website defacement, data theft, SEO spam.
- **Status**: Malicious downloads removed; compromise window lasted several days.

### OpenVSX Extension Repository Zero-Day
- **Description**: Permission misconfiguration in OpenVSX let attackers replace any listed extension, enabling auto-update hijacking for IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf.
- **Impact**: Arbitrary code execution on millions of developer machines.
- **Status**: Zero-day swiftly patched; no confirmed mass exploitation, but threat window existed prior to fix.
