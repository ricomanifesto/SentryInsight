   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint.
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations using these products should apply the latest security patches and updates provided by VMware and Microsoft.

3. **Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT**
   - **CVE IDs**: Not specified in the articles.
   - **Description**: A zero-day vulnerability in a chat application was exploited by a Turkish APT group known as Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Affected Systems**: Specific chat application used by military targets.
   - **Mitigation**: Users of the affected chat application should apply patches as soon as they are available and consider using alternative secure communication platforms.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Firefox Zero-Days Patched**
   - **CVE IDs**: Not specified in the articles.
   - **Description**: Mozilla released patches for two zero-day vulnerabilities in Firefox that were demonstrated at Pwn2Own Berlin 2025.
   - **Affected Systems**: Mozilla Firefox browser.
   - **Mitigation**: Users should ensure their Firefox browsers are updated to the latest version to protect against these vulnerabilities.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Description**: A new tool called 'Defendnot' can disable Microsoft Defender on Windows devices by registering a fake antivirus product.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices with Microsoft Defender.
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should monitor for unauthorized changes to antivirus configurations and consider using additional security solutions to detect and prevent such tampering.

2. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Description**: A new malware campaign uses a PowerShell-based shellcode loader to deploy the Remcos RAT via LNK files and MSHTA.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows systems.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement email filtering to block malicious attachments, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block fileless malware.

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Turkish APT Group (Marbled Dust/Sea Turtle)**
   - **Activity**: Exploited a chat app zero-day to spy on Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should monitor for indicators of compromise associated with this APT group and apply security patches promptly.

2. **Ransomware Gangs Using Skitnet**
   - **Activity**: Ransomware gangs are increasingly using Skitnet malware for post-exploitation activities.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust backup strategies and use advanced threat detection tools to identify and mitigate ransomware threats.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

2. **Security Awareness Training**: Educate employees about phishing attacks and the importance of not opening suspicious emails or attachments.

3. **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malware and unauthorized changes to system configurations.

4. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring to detect unusual activity that may indicate an ongoing attack.

5. **Incident Response Planning**: Develop and regularly update incident response plans to ensure quick and effective responses to security incidents.

By following these recommendations and staying informed about the latest threats, organizations can better protect themselves against the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
