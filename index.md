# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently dominated by ransomware campaigns targeting enterprise infrastructure and emerging threats leveraging AI technologies. The Akira ransomware group is actively exploiting SonicWall SSL VPN vulnerabilities to breach MFA-protected accounts, while CISA has added a critical Sudo vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation in Linux and Unix systems. Additionally, threat actors are deploying sophisticated malware campaigns including the Datzbro Android banking trojan, EvilAI malware masquerading as legitimate AI tools, and AI-enhanced phishing attacks using LLM-generated SVG files to bypass email security systems.
