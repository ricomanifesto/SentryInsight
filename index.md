# Exploitation Report

Multiple critical exploitation campaigns are currently targeting enterprise environments and consumer devices. The most significant threats include two cybercriminal groups, UNC6040 and UNC6395, actively compromising Salesforce environments for data theft and extortion purposes. Additionally, a newly discovered phishing-as-a-service platform called VoidProxy is targeting Microsoft 365 and Google accounts, while the WhiteCobra threat actor has flooded VSCode marketplaces with cryptocurrency-stealing extensions. Samsung has addressed a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21043) that was actively exploited in Android attacks, and CISA has warned of active exploitation of a remote code execution flaw in Dassault DELMIA Apriso systems. A sophisticated new ransomware strain called HybridPetya has emerged with the capability to bypass UEFI Secure Boot protections.
