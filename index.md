# Exploitation Report

Recent threat-intelligence reporting highlights a surge in targeted, high-impact exploitation activity. The most critical event is the weaponization of a critical SAP NetWeaver flaw (CVE-2025-31324) in an intrusion that dropped new “Auto-Color” Linux malware inside a U.S. chemical company’s environment. Simultaneously, ransomware operators continue to broaden their reach, with the nimble “Gunra” crew unveiling a Linux encryptor, and multiple large-scale incidents (City of Saint Paul, Aeroflot, Orange) underscore how quickly operational disruption follows initial compromise. Phishing campaigns against PyPI maintainers, mobile “choicejacking,” and emergent rogue-access abuse tactics round out the current threat landscape, showing a diverse mix of exploitation vectors and adversary objectives.

## Active Exploitation Details

### SAP NetWeaver Auto-Color Exploit
- **Description**: A critical flaw in SAP NetWeaver Application Server allows unauthenticated attackers to abuse a request-handling weakness, leading to remote code execution. Threat actors leveraged the bug to deploy a bespoke Linux payload dubbed “Auto-Color.”
- **Impact**: Full system takeover, deployment of post-exploitation malware, lateral movement across SAP-connected hosts, and potential theft or manipulation of sensitive ERP data.
- **Status**: Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation against at least one U.S. chemicals firm. SAP has issued patches and customers are urged to apply them immediately.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-31324

## Affected Systems and Products

- **SAP NetWeaver Application Server (ABAP & Java stacks)**  
  • Versions prior to the vendor’s July 2025 security update  
  • On-premise and cloud-hosted deployments

- **Linux-based production servers**  
  • Hosts where Auto-Color malware is sideloaded post-exploit  
  • Likely any modern distribution running on x86-64 infrastructure

- **Enterprise environments targeted by Gunra ransomware**  
  • Windows Server 2016–2022 and major Linux distributions  
  • VMware ESXi indicated as an emerging target for the new Linux build

- **Python Package Index (PyPI) user base**  
  • Maintainers receiving fraudulent “account verification” emails  
  • All operating systems running development tooling that accesses PyPI

- **Mobile devices (Android & iOS)**  
  • Susceptible to malicious QR codes and pop-up overlays used in choicejacking attacks

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **NetWeaver HTTP Request Deserialization**  
  • Vector: Crafted HTTP(S) requests exploiting CVE-2025-31324 to execute code in the OS context of the SAP host.

- **Post-Exploit Linux Malware Deployment (Auto-Color)**  
  • Technique: Dropper writes and executes an ELF payload that beacons and facilitates additional tooling.

- **Cross-Platform Ransomware Encryption (Gunra Linux Variant)**  
  • Vector: SSH or exposed management services compromised via stolen creds/brute-force; payload uses multithreaded encryption routines optimized for EXT4 and XFS volumes.

- **Supply-Chain Phishing on PyPI**  
  • Technique: Look-alike domains and TLS-certificates lure developers to credential-harvesting portals mimicking the official package index.

- **Choicejacking (Malicious Charging Station UX Manipulation)**  
  • Vector: HTML/JS overlays presented in captive-portal screens trick users into altering device settings or approving malicious app installs.

- **Rogue Access Abuse**  
  • Technique: Attackers leverage mis-scoped identity governance rules to accumulate “shadow” privileges that bypass normal IGA oversight.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Unknown SAP-focused Intrusion Set**  
  • Campaign: Deployed Auto-Color malware through CVE-2025-31324; targeting U.S. chemical sector; objectives appear to be espionage and foothold establishment for future operations.

- **Gunra Ransomware Group**  
  • Campaign: Rolled out a Linux variant to extend operations beyond Windows; actively exfiltrates data before encryption; opportunistic targeting of manufacturing and technology firms.

- **City of Saint Paul Cyberattack (Actor Undisclosed)**  
  • Campaign: Disruption of municipal services prompting National Guard cyber assistance; probable ransomware TTPs; investigation ongoing.

- **Aeroflot Incident (Actor Undisclosed)**  
  • Campaign: Service-desk compromise leading to flight cancellations and delays; indicates operational technology (OT) impact aspirations.

- **Orange Breach (Actor Undisclosed)**  
  • Campaign: Initial access to internal system detected; quick disclosure suggests containment but reinforces telecom sector attractiveness.

- **Phishing Actors Targeting PyPI**  
  • Campaign: Ongoing social-engineering wave leveraging look-alike domains to hijack developer accounts and poison software-supply chains.

- **Mobile Choicejacking Operators**  
  • Campaign: Criminal crews setting up tampered public charging stations (airports, malls) to coerce device policy changes and propagate malicious apps.

- **Rogue-Access Exploiters**  
  • Campaign: Cloud-focused threat actors abusing inadequate identity-governance thresholds to silently elevate privileges in enterprise SaaS and IaaS environments.

---

Organizations running SAP NetWeaver should prioritize the CVE-2025-31324 patch, audit for suspicious Linux binaries (“Auto-Color”), and harden network segmentation around ERP assets. Concurrently, defenders must monitor for cross-platform ransomware tooling, step up credential-phishing defenses for development teams, and enforce strict identity-governance controls to pre-empt rogue-access abuse.
