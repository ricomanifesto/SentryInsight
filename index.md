# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple enterprise platforms, with the Cl0p ransomware group leading a significant campaign against Oracle E-Business Suite customers using CVE-2025-61882. Additional zero-day exploitation has been observed targeting Zimbra Collaboration Suite through malicious calendar files (CVE-2025-27915), while ransomware groups continue to exploit recently disclosed vulnerabilities in GoAnywhere MFT systems. These attacks demonstrate sophisticated threat actors' ability to rapidly weaponize newly discovered vulnerabilities before organizations can implement patches.
