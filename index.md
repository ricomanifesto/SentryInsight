# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway. Most notably, threat actors have been actively exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in legacy Sitecore deployments to deploy WeepSteel reconnaissance malware. Additionally, TP-Link has confirmed an unpatched zero-day vulnerability affecting multiple router models, while CISA has warned that other router flaws are being exploited in attacks. Russian state-sponsored group APT28 has deployed a new Microsoft Outlook backdoor called NotDoor in targeted campaigns against NATO countries, and the GhostRedirector threat cluster has compromised at least 65 Windows servers using sophisticated backdoor techniques.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Sitecore Zero-Day Vulnerability
