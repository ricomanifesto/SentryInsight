# Exploitation Report

Recent security articles have highlighted significant exploitation activity, particularly focusing on a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft’s Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) that has been actively exploited in the wild. Additionally, Microsoft has patched a total of 67 vulnerabilities, including this zero-day, during their June 2025 Patch Tuesday. Other notable vulnerabilities include a Secure Boot flaw that allows for the installation of bootkit malware, and a Roundcube vulnerability that enables authenticated attackers to gain complete control over webmail servers.

## Active Exploitation Details

### WebDAV Zero-Day
- **Description**: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s WebDAV service that allows attackers to exploit the system remotely.
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; patches have been released by Microsoft.
- **CVE ID**: Not explicitly mentioned.

### Secure Boot Flaw
- **Description**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass Secure Boot protections, enabling the installation of bootkit malware.
- **Impact**: This flaw can lead to persistent malware installation that survives system reboots.
- **Status**: Recently disclosed and patched; users are urged to apply the updates immediately.
