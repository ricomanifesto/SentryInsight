# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is experiencing significant exploitation activity across multiple vectors, with threat actors increasingly leveraging AI technologies and targeting cloud infrastructure. Most notably, FreePBX servers are under active attack through a zero-day vulnerability affecting systems with exposed Administrator Control Panels. Meanwhile, sophisticated threat actors like Storm-0501 have evolved their operations to focus on cloud-based attacks, exploiting Entra ID to conduct data exfiltration and deletion in hybrid cloud environments. The emergence of AI-powered ransomware variants like PromptLock demonstrates the evolution of malware capabilities, while state-sponsored groups continue to exploit network infrastructure for espionage purposes.
