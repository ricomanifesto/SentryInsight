# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited across multiple platforms, with the most urgent threat being a critical Sudo flaw affecting Linux and Unix systems that CISA has added to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Additionally, Akira ransomware operators are conducting broad campaigns targeting SonicWall VPN devices, successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication protections. Malicious actors are also leveraging sophisticated techniques including AI-crafted phishing campaigns using SVG files, malicious MCP servers for data exfiltration, and supply chain attacks affecting major automotive manufacturers.
