# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerability exploitation activity has been identified across multiple high-profile systems, with the most severe incidents involving zero-day attacks and infrastructure breaches. The Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centre has reported active exploitation of a critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2025-6543) that successfully breached critical organizations in the country. Additionally, researchers have documented zero-day attacks exploiting a WinRAR path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-8088) by the Russian RomCom hacking group to distribute malware. Law enforcement operations have also disrupted BlackSuit ransomware infrastructure, while the North Korean Kimsuky group has reportedly suffered a data breach exposing their operations.
