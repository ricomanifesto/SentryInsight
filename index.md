# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, there are several significant cybersecurity threats and malware campaigns currently active. Two new malware families have been discovered: CHILLYHELL, a modular Apple macOS backdoor, and ZynorRAT, a Go-based remote access trojan capable of targeting macOS, Windows, and Linux systems. Additionally, the China-linked APT41 group is conducting ongoing targeted cyber espionage campaigns against U.S. trade officials during sensitive 2025 negotiations. Microsoft has also addressed 80 security vulnerabilities in their August 2025 security updates, including critical SMB privilege escalation flaws and Azure vulnerabilities with CVSS 10.0 scores. A new Phishing-as-a-Service platform called Salty2FA has emerged, specifically targeting U.S. and European enterprises.
