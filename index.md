# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in the wild, with Oracle E-Business Suite and Zimbra Collaboration Suite representing the most significant immediate threats. The Oracle EBS zero-day vulnerability CVE-2025-61882 is being actively exploited by the Clop ransomware group for unauthenticated remote code execution and data theft operations. Meanwhile, a Zimbra flaw was exploited as a zero-day through malicious iCalendar attachments at the beginning of the year. Additionally, CISA has flagged the Meteobridge vulnerability CVE-2025-4008 as actively exploited, while threat actors are conducting massive reconnaissance campaigns against Palo Alto Networks login portals with scanning activity increasing by 500% in a single day.
