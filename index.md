# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threat landscape reveals critical exploitation activity across multiple attack vectors, with the most severe being a maximum CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in Fortra GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035) enabling command injection attacks. Concurrently, threat actors are actively exploiting Ivanti EPMM vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) with sophisticated malware campaigns. Iranian state-sponsored groups are conducting highly targeted espionage operations against telecommunications infrastructure, while proxy botnets and phishing-as-a-service operations continue to scale globally. The SonicWall breach exposes critical firewall configurations, highlighting the ongoing risks to enterprise security infrastructure.
