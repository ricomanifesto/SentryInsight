# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical exploitation activities are currently underway, including sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting developer infrastructure, data breaches affecting major platforms, and advanced malware campaigns designed to evade security tools. The most significant incidents include the GhostAction GitHub supply chain attack that compromised over 3,000 secrets, multiple JavaScript package compromises affecting billions of weekly downloads, and the deployment of advanced EDR-killing malware. Additionally, threat actors continue to leverage longstanding infrastructure for cyber espionage operations, while organizations face breaches through compromised developer accounts and authentication systems.

## Active Exploitation Details

### GhostAction GitHub Supply Chain Attack
- **Description**: A sophisticated supply chain attack targeting GitHub repositories that successfully compromised authentication secrets and tokens
- **Impact**: Attackers gained access to 3,325 secrets including PyPI, npm, DockerHub, GitHub tokens, Cloudflare, and AWS keys
- **Status**: Active exploitation confirmed with widespread impact across multiple cloud platforms and services

### JavaScript Package Compromise Campaign
- **Description**: Coordinated attack against 18 popular JavaScript code packages collectively downloaded over two billion times weekly
- **Impact**: Malicious code injection designed to steal cryptocurrency from affected systems and applications
- **Status**: Packages were briefly compromised with malicious software before detection and remediation

### Salesloft GitHub Account Compromise
- **Description**: Breach initiated through compromised GitHub developer accounts leading to extensive supply chain impact
- **Impact**: Massive supply chain attack resulting in compromise of hundreds of Salesforce instances through stolen OAuth tokens
