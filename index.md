# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing significant exploitation activity, with several critical zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild. The most concerning developments include a perfect CVSS 10.0 Adobe Experience Manager vulnerability already under active attack, two Windows zero-days affecting all versions ever shipped, nation-state breaches targeting F5 BIG-IP systems with stolen vulnerability details, and Oracle zero-day attacks against academic institutions. Additionally, multiple industrial control systems face critical vulnerabilities, while threat actors are leveraging sophisticated supply chain attacks through malicious development tools and extensions.
