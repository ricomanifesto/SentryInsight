# Exploitation Report

Current threat landscape analysis reveals several critical exploitation activities targeting enterprise systems and software supply chains. The most significant active exploitation involves a critical SAP S/4HANA vulnerability (CVE-2025-42957) that requires minimal effort to exploit and can result in complete system compromise. Additionally, sophisticated supply chain attacks are targeting developers through malicious NPM packages, including the "s1ngularity" campaign that compromised over 2,180 GitHub accounts and campaigns targeting Ethereum developers through fake Flashbots packages. A Russian-linked threat group called Noisy Bear is conducting targeted phishing operations against Kazakhstan's energy sector, while innovative attack vectors are emerging through SVG file-based phishing campaigns and AI-powered malware distribution.

## Active Exploitation Details

### SAP S/4HANA Critical Vulnerability
