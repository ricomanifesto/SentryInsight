# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a FortiWeb web application firewall authentication bypass vulnerability that allows complete security circumvention, a Russian threat group exploiting a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability to deploy stealer malware, a critical Cisco Firewall Management Center vulnerability with maximum severity rating, and sophisticated ransomware attacks that can bypass endpoint detection and response systems. Additionally, mobile phishing campaigns are targeting financial services with advanced techniques, while Android banking trojans continue to evolve with leaked source code enabling broader malicious activities.
