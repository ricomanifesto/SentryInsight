# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day exploitation activity has been identified with Apple releasing emergency security updates to address CVE-2025-43300, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability actively exploited in targeted attacks across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS platforms. Additionally, Russian threat actors are conducting widespread attacks against thousands of end-of-life Cisco devices using a seven-year-old vulnerability, while cybercriminals are increasingly abusing AI-powered website builders for malicious activities. The Scattered Spider cybercrime collective continues to demonstrate significant impact through SIM swapping operations, with recent sentencing highlighting the scale of cryptocurrency theft operations.
