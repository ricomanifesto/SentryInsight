# Exploitation Report

In the last week, threat activity has centered on supply-chain attacks against software repositories, novel abuse of Android virtualization to compromise mobile banking applications, continued exploitation by state-aligned and financially motivated groups (e.g., Lazarus, Scattered Spider, Salt Typhoon), and record-breaking network-layer denial-of-service assaults. These campaigns show a clear trend toward abusing trusted ecosystems (GitHub, Android, cloud infrastructure) rather than relying on traditional endpoint exploits, allowing adversaries to achieve code execution, credential theft, and large-scale disruption with minimal malware footprints.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Malicious Copycat GitHub Repositories
- **Description**: Threat actors uploaded dozens of repositories that mimic popular open-source projects but contain weaponized scripts and backdoors.  
- **Impact**: Developers who clone or fork the repos execute malicious code that steals credentials, installs RATs, or implants CI/CD backdoors, enabling supply-chain compromise of downstream applications.  
- **Status**: Actively removed by GitHub’s security team, but new repos continue to appear; users must verify repository provenance before consumption.  

### Trojanized GitHub Repositories Campaign (200+ Repos)
- **Description**: Researchers uncovered a parallel campaign seeding more than 200 Python-branded “hacking tool” repos that actually deliver Discord token stealers and infostealers.  
- **Impact**: Direct theft of authentication tokens, lateral movement into Discord communities, exfiltration of browser-stored passwords, and potential privilege escalation on developer workstations.  
- **Status**: Ongoing takedown efforts; no official patch—mitigation depends on user validation of repository authenticity.  

### Android Virtualization Abuse – “Godfather” Malware
- **Description**: The latest Godfather variant deploys an isolated virtual environment on infected devices, allowing the malware to launch cloned instances of legitimate banking apps outside Android’s normal security context.  
- **Impact**: Attackers bypass biometric and MFA controls, intercept session tokens, and hijack live banking transactions without triggering standard OS protections.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; Google Play Protect updates and OEM security patches are rolling out, but sideloaded APKs remain vulnerable.  

### Android Overlay/NFC Exfiltration – “AntiDot” Malware
- **Description**: AntiDot leverages accessibility overlays, malicious virtualization, and NFC channel abuse to harvest credentials and perform unauthorized contactless payments.  
- **Impact**: Full account takeover of financial apps, stealthy wire transfers, and unauthorized NFC purchases straight from compromised devices.  
- **Status**: Campaign spans 273 distinct attack waves; no OS-level patch yet—users must restrict accessibility privileges and block sideloading.  

### Salt Typhoon (Volt Typhoon) Intrusion into Viasat
- **Description**: The Chinese state-aligned group breached satellite telecom Viasat using living-off-the-land techniques against edge infrastructure and cloud resources.  
- **Impact**: Potential reconnaissance of critical communications networks and staging for future disruption, though Viasat reports no service impact to customers.  
- **Status**: Incident response ongoing; mitigations include credential resets and hardening of external-facing management interfaces.  

### Scattered Spider Retail & Insurance Intrusions
- **Description**: Scattered Spider orchestrated a combined cyber event impacting Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and multiple U.S. insurers (including Aflac), relying on social-engineering, SIM-swap, and identity-provider abuse.  
- **Impact**: Estimated damages up to $592 M, exposure of personal data, and operational outages across retail supply chains.  
- **Status**: Active; affected organizations are patching IAM policies and increasing MFA rigor.  

### Lazarus Group Breach of BitoPro Cryptocurrency Exchange
- **Description**: Lazarus used spear-phishing and backdoored trading tools to infiltrate BitoPro, siphoning $11 M in digital assets.  
- **Impact**: Direct financial theft, reputational damage, and possible leverage for further attacks via stolen customer keys.  
- **Status**: Exchange operations restored; law-enforcement coordination underway, but funds largely laundered through mixer services.  

### Record-Breaking 7.3 Tbps DDoS Attack
- **Description**: Cloudflare mitigated the largest recorded DDoS burst, which delivered 37.4 TB in 45 seconds against a hosting provider.  
- **Impact**: Potential knock-out of hosting infrastructure, cascading service disruption for downstream SaaS tenants, saturation of upstream bandwidth.  
- **Status**: Attack neutralized; no vendor patch required, but organizations are urged to employ layered DDoS defenses.  

### OneDrive Search Function Bug (Under Investigation)
- **Description**: A Microsoft OneDrive flaw breaks file search, returning blank results, which attackers could exploit for “security through obscurity” or data-hiding in insider scenarios.  
- **Impact**: Reduces defenders’ visibility, aiding persistence and data exfiltration under the guise of normal cloud storage operations.  
- **Status**: Microsoft investigation ongoing; remediation guidance pending.
