# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing a critical wave of zero-day exploitations, with Cisco devices at the epicenter of active attacks. Multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA firewalls and IOS software are being actively exploited by threat actors, including nation-state groups, to deploy sophisticated malware such as RayInitiator and LINE VIPER. These attacks have prompted emergency directives from CISA ordering federal agencies to immediately patch affected systems. Additionally, supply chain attacks targeting developers through malicious packages in npm and Rust repositories, along with advanced AI prompt injection vulnerabilities in Salesforce platforms, are creating new attack vectors that organizations must address urgently.
