# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, several critical vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewalls, exploitation of a patched Microsoft Windows vulnerability by Russian threat actors, and the emergence of new ransomware variants with advanced EDR evasion capabilities. Additionally, the complete source code leak of ERMAC 3.0 banking trojan has exposed the full malware infrastructure, potentially enabling widespread Android banking attacks.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FortiWeb Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical vulnerability in FortiWeb web application firewall that allows remote attackers to completely bypass authentication mechanisms
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected web applications and potentially compromise entire network infrastructures
- **Status**: Proof of concept exploit has been released by security researchers, increasing risk of widespread exploitation

### Microsoft Windows MSC EvilTwin Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security flaw in Microsoft Windows that has been patched but continues to be exploited by threat actors
- **Impact**: Enables deployment of malicious payloads including the Fickle Stealer malware for credential theft and system compromise
- **Status**: Patched by Microsoft but actively exploited by EncryptHub threat group

### Cisco Firewall Management Center Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical security hole in Cisco's Firewall Management Center with a severity rating of 10
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise with no available mitigation or workaround options
- **Status**: Recently patched by Cisco, immediate patching required

## Affected Systems and Products
