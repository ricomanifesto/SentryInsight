# Exploitation Report

Current exploitation activities reveal a concerning landscape of actively exploited vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. State-sponsored threat actors have exploited vulnerabilities in Libraesva Email Security Gateway solutions, while attackers successfully breached a U.S. federal civilian executive branch agency through an unpatched GeoServer instance. Critical remote code execution flaws in SolarWinds Web Help Desk (CVE-2025-26399) and Supermicro BMC firmware pose significant risks to enterprise infrastructure. The threat landscape is further complicated by sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting the npm ecosystem, DDoS botnet operations leveraging misconfigured Docker containers, and SEO poisoning campaigns deploying malware through compromised web servers.
