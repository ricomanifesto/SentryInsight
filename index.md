# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild, with Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile facing immediate exploitation. Threat actors continue to leverage both zero-day vulnerabilities and recently patched flaws to conduct targeted attacks against enterprise infrastructure, including major breaches of security vendors like SonicWall and large-scale data theft operations targeting Salesforce records. Russian-backed groups are demonstrating increased collaboration, while financially motivated actors are employing AI-generated attack tools and sophisticated malware loaders to expand their operations.
