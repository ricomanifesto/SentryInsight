# Exploitation Report

Current exploitation activity is dominated by several critical zero-day vulnerabilities and active malware campaigns. The most severe threat involves a maximum severity zero-day vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035) that allows remote command injection without authentication and has been actively exploited for over a week. Cisco network infrastructure faces significant threats with multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in ASA firewalls and IOS systems being exploited by nation-state actors to deploy advanced backdoors. Malware distribution campaigns are leveraging sophisticated techniques including fake software installers, supply chain attacks, and AI-powered phishing to compromise organizations worldwide. China-linked APT groups continue targeting telecommunications and manufacturing sectors across Asia with advanced persistent access tools.
