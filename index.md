# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals several critical security incidents involving active exploitation of vulnerabilities across multiple platforms. Most notably, WhatsApp has addressed a zero-day vulnerability in its iOS and macOS messaging clients that was actively exploited in targeted attacks. Additionally, threat actors are leveraging legitimate forensic tools like Velociraptor to deploy Visual Studio Code for command and control tunneling, while malware campaigns continue to distribute infostealers through fraudulent applications promoted via Google ads. The Sitecore Experience Platform has also been identified with multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to information disclosure and remote code execution through exploit chains.

## Active Exploitation Details

### WhatsApp Zero-Click Vulnerability
- **Description**: A security vulnerability in WhatsApp's iOS and macOS messaging clients that enables zero-click exploitation
- **Impact**: Allows attackers to compromise devices without user interaction, potentially leading to unauthorized access to messaging data and device control
- **Status**: Patched by WhatsApp in emergency update; was actively exploited in targeted zero-day attacks

### Sitecore Experience Platform Exploit Chain
- **Description**: Three security vulnerabilities in the Sitecore Experience Platform that can be chained together for comprehensive system compromise
- **Impact**: Attackers can achieve information disclosure and remote code execution through cache poisoning techniques
- **Status**: Vulnerabilities disclosed by researchers; exploitation potential confirmed through proof-of-concept

### TamperedChef Infostealer Campaign
- **Description**: Malware distribution campaign using fraudulent PDF editing applications to deliver information-stealing malware
- **Impact**: Credential theft, browser data extraction, and potential system compromise through stolen authentication tokens
- **Status**: Active campaign using Google ads to promote malicious websites hosting fake PDF editors
