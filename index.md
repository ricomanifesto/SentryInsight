# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are currently being actively exploited in widespread attacks targeting Cisco network infrastructure, with CISA issuing emergency directives for federal agencies. The most significant threats include multiple Cisco ASA firewall zero-days exploited by nation-state actors, an actively exploited SNMP vulnerability in Cisco IOS software allowing remote code execution, and a critical GeoServer flaw that enabled attackers to breach a federal agency. Additional concerns include sophisticated malware campaigns targeting developers through supply chain attacks, including XCSSET macOS malware variants and malicious packages in npm and Rust repositories designed to steal credentials and cryptocurrency keys.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Cisco ASA Firewall Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting the VPN web server of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to firewall systems and potentially compromise network infrastructure
- **Status**: Actively exploited in attacks; CISA has issued emergency directive ordering federal agencies to patch immediately

### Cisco IOS SNMP Vulnerability
- **Description**: High-severity security flaw in Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software affecting SNMP functionality
- **Impact**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or trigger denial-of-service conditions
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; patches available from Cisco

### GeoServer Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: Critical vulnerability in GeoServer geospatial software
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive geospatial data
- **Status**: Exploited within two weeks of disclosure to breach a large federal civilian executive branch agency
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-36401

### Cisco Zero-Day Wave Targeting Firewalls and IOS
- **Description**: Four actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities affecting millions of Cisco devices, with three specifically targeted by nation-state actors
- **Impact**: Complete device compromise, persistent access, and network infrastructure takeover
- **Status**: Recently disclosed by Cisco with active exploitation confirmed; linked to "ArcaneDoor" nation-state campaign

### Salesforce AI Prompt Injection Vulnerability (ForcedLeak)
- **Description**: Critical flaw in Salesforce Agentforce platform allowing indirect prompt injection attacks against AI agents
- **Impact**: Attackers can potentially exfiltrate sensitive CRM data and customer information through AI agent manipulation
- **Status**: Recently patched by Salesforce after researcher disclosure

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Cisco ASA/FTD Firewalls**: VPN web server components in Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance and Threat Defense software
- **Cisco IOS/IOS XE**: SNMP functionality in various versions of Cisco's networking operating systems
- **GeoServer**: Geospatial data management software used by federal agencies
- **Xcode Development Environment**: macOS developers using Apple's Xcode IDE targeted by XCSSET malware variants
- **npm Package Registry**: Developers using unofficial 'postmark-mcp' package for email functionality
- **Rust Crates.io Repository**: Developers downloading malicious 'fast_log' impersonation packages
- **Salesforce Agentforce**: AI agent platform for customer relationship management
- **Supermicro BMC**: Baseboard Management Controller firmware in server hardware
- **Network Edge Devices**: Various network appliances that cannot run traditional EDR agents

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Zero-Day Exploitation**: Nation-state actors leveraging undisclosed vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure
- **Supply Chain Poisoning**: Malicious packages uploaded to legitimate repositories (npm, Crates.io) to steal developer credentials
- **Prompt Injection**: Sophisticated attacks against AI systems to bypass security controls and extract sensitive data
- **Browser Targeting**: Enhanced malware variants specifically designed to compromise web browsers and steal session data
- **DNS Tunneling**: Threat actors generating massive DNS query volumes to power malware command and control networks
- **Social Engineering**: Cryptocurrency developer targeting through fake job interviews and development projects
- **Firmware Backdoors**: Persistent malware installation in BMC firmware to maintain long-term access
- **Network Appliance Compromise**: Targeting edge devices that lack traditional endpoint protection

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Nation-State Actors**: Systematic targeting of Cisco infrastructure using zero-day vulnerabilities in the "ArcaneDoor" campaign
- **UNC5221 (Chinese APT)**: Deploying "Brickstorm" backdoors on network edge devices for persistent access and espionage
- **North Korean Groups**: Using AkdoorTea backdoor and TsunamiKit tools in "Contagious Interview" campaigns targeting cryptocurrency developers
- **Scattered Spider**: Despite claims of shutdown, continued high-impact attacks including $107 million loss at Co-operative Group
- **Vane Viper**: Operating massive malware and ad fraud network generating over 1 trillion DNS queries globally
- **Supply Chain Attackers**: Systematically poisoning developer repositories with credential-stealing malware targeting cryptocurrency wallets
