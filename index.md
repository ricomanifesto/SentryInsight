# Exploitation Report

Over the past week, threat activity has concentrated on large-scale data exposure, supply-chain compromise, cloud-service abuse, and highly disruptive DDoS operations. A 16-billion-credential compilation and multiple smaller password leaks are already fuelling automated account-takeover attacks, while Lazarus, Scattered Spider, and Salt Typhoon are conducting financially and geopolitically-motivated intrusions. GitHub has become a prime delivery channel for weaponized repositories, and Android malware crews are innovating with virtualization techniques that bypass traditional protections. Cloud infrastructure was also tested as Cloudflare mitigated the largest recorded DDoS event (7.3 Tbps), leveraging the HTTP/2 “Rapid Reset” weakness. Collectively, these events highlight an escalating trend toward exploiting misconfigurations, supply-chain trust, and protocol design flaws rather than traditional endpoint vulnerabilities.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Credential Megabreach Compilation
- **Description**: A 16-billion-record trove aggregating credentials from thousands of historical breaches was circulated on underground forums. Although not a single new breach, the scale and recency of some data have renewed active credential-stuffing campaigns.  
- **Impact**: Enables automated account takeover, lateral movement, business-email compromise (BEC), and phishing-resistant MFA bypass attempts via “MFA fatigue.”  
- **Status**: Widely traded; no patch possible—requires immediate credential hygiene and MFA enforcement.

### Scattered Spider Retail & Insurance Intrusions
- **Description**: Social-engineering-driven intrusions at Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Aflac. The group abused identity-provider sessions and device-management tools to escalate privileges, exfiltrate data, and trigger extortion.  
- **Impact**: Operational disruption, customer PII theft, and estimated $592 million in losses.  
- **Status**: Ongoing; organizations are hardening IAM policies and revoking compromised tokens.

### Lazarus Cryptocurrency Exchange Breach
- **Description**: North Korean Lazarus operators compromised BitoPro’s hot-wallet infrastructure, siphoning $11 million in digital assets. Initial access reportedly gained through spear-phishing and exploitation of internal API keys.  
- **Impact**: Direct financial theft, market manipulation risks, and follow-on laundering through mixers.  
- **Status**: Active investigation; exchange rotated keys and tightened wallet segregation.

### GitHub Malicious Copycat Repositories
- **Description**: Over 200 look-alike repos mimicking popular projects were uploaded, each embedding obfuscated malware loaders and token stealers. Unsuspecting developers imported the code via GitHub Actions or pip/npm installs.  
- **Impact**: Developer workstation takeover, CI/CD pipeline compromise, and downstream supply-chain infection.  
- **Status**: Some repos removed; campaign remains active with new uploads daily.

### Salt Typhoon (China-Nexus) Cloud Intrusions
- **Description**: Viasat confirmed compromise attributed to Salt Typhoon, which leverages misconfigured edge devices and stolen credentials to burrow into cloud tenant workloads and exfiltrate telecom data.  
- **Impact**: Potential espionage of satellite communications and infrastructure mapping.  
- **Status**: Actors still probing additional telecoms; mitigations include zero-trust segmentation and credential rotation.

### HTTP/2 Rapid-Reset DDoS Abuse
- **Description**: Hosting provider hit with a 7.3 Tbps attack exploiting the HTTP/2 connection-cancellation technique (“Rapid Reset”), overwhelming L7 resources.  
- **Impact**: Service downtime, elevated transit costs, and collateral customer outages.  
- **Status**: Cloudflare mitigated; protocol patches and rate-limiting strategies recommended.

### Godfather & AntiDot Android Virtualization Exploits
- **Description**: New malware strains create isolated virtual containers to run hijacked banking apps, invisibly intercepting credentials and NFC transactions while evading integrity checks.  
- **Impact**: Full account takeover, unauthorized transfers, and contactless-payment fraud.  
- **Status**: Actively spreading through phishing SMS and trojanized APKs; no vendor patch—users must sideload defensively and keep Play Protect active.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Credential Stuffing & Password Reuse**
  - **Vector**: Automated login attempts using leaked credential lists against popular services

- **Social Engineering & MFA Fatigue**
  - **Vector**: Phone/SMS phishing masquerading as IT support to approve push notifications

- **Supply-Chain Poisoning via GitHub**
  - **Vector**: Import of malicious packages/repositories that maintain original project names

- **API Key Theft & Hot-Wallet Manipulation**
  - **Vector**: Compromised internal keys leveraged to sign fraudulent crypto transactions
