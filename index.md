# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity has been identified in recent security updates, with Google addressing 120 security vulnerabilities in Android's September 2025 security update, including two zero-day vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited in the wild. Additionally, threat actors are rapidly weaponizing AI-powered offensive security tools to exploit recently disclosed Citrix vulnerabilities within just one week of their public disclosure. Iranian state-sponsored actors have also been conducting sophisticated multi-wave phishing campaigns targeting diplomatic missions globally, successfully compromising over 100 embassy email accounts across Europe and other regions.
