# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, current exploitation activity is primarily focused on social engineering attacks and supply chain compromises rather than traditional vulnerability exploitation. The most significant threats include sophisticated phishing campaigns leveraging trusted platforms like Apple's iCloud Calendar system, AI-powered supply chain attacks targeting developer ecosystems, and nation-state activities targeting critical infrastructure. These attacks demonstrate a shift toward exploiting trust relationships and legitimate services rather than relying solely on software vulnerabilities.
