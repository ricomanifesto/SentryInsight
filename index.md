# Exploitation Report

Recent security articles highlight significant exploitation activity, particularly focusing on a zero-day vulnerability exploited by the Stealth Falcon APT group, as well as a newly disclosed Secure Boot flaw (CVE-2025-3052) that allows attackers to install bootkit malware. Additionally, Microsoft has patched 66 vulnerabilities, including one that was actively exploited prior to the patch release. The ongoing threat landscape is characterized by sophisticated attacks leveraging both newly discovered and previously patched vulnerabilities.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft RCE Zero-Day
- **Description**: A remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft products that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems.
- **Impact**: Attackers can gain full control over compromised systems, potentially leading to data theft, system manipulation, or further network infiltration.
- **Status**: Actively exploited in the wild; Microsoft has released patches as part of their June 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.
  
### Secure Boot Bypass (CVE-2025-3052)
- **Description**: A vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass Secure Boot protections, enabling the installation of bootkit malware on PCs and servers.
- **Impact**: This flaw can lead to persistent malware installation, allowing attackers to maintain control over the system even after reboots.
- **Status**: Recently disclosed and patched; users are urged to apply the updates immediately to mitigate risks.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Windows Operating Systems**: Various versions affected by the RCE zero-day and other vulnerabilities patched in June 2025.
- **Secure Boot Systems**: Any PC or server utilizing Secure Boot technology is at risk due to the newly disclosed vulnerability.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Remote Code Execution**: Attackers exploit the RCE vulnerability to execute malicious code remotely, often through phishing emails or compromised websites.
- **Bootkit Installation**: The Secure Boot bypass allows attackers to disable security features and install persistent malware that can survive system reboots.

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Actor/Group**: Stealth Falcon APT
  - **Activities**: This group has been observed exploiting the Microsoft RCE zero-day vulnerability to target organizations in the Middle East.
  
- **Campaign**: The exploitation of the RCE vulnerability is part of a broader campaign aimed at infiltrating sensitive networks and stealing data.

This report underscores the importance of timely patching and vigilance against emerging threats, particularly those involving zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack techniques. Organizations are advised to review their security postures and ensure that all systems are updated to mitigate these risks.
