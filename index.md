# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day vulnerabilities are being actively exploited across multiple enterprise platforms, with the most severe threats targeting Cisco ASA firewalls and Fortra GoAnywhere MFT systems. Nation-state actors, particularly China-linked groups, are leveraging these vulnerabilities to deploy sophisticated malware including RayInitiator, LINE VIPER, and Brickstorm backdoors. The exploitation landscape is further complicated by AI-driven phishing campaigns using LLM-generated code to evade security controls, while ransomware groups continue to breach MFA-protected systems through novel techniques.
