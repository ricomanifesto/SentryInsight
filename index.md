# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical exploitation campaigns targeting enterprise infrastructure and supply chain components. State-sponsored actors are actively deploying XenoRAT malware against diplomatic targets in South Korea, while the Noodlophile stealer campaign has expanded globally using sophisticated copyright-themed phishing lures. Multiple data breaches have impacted major organizations including Allianz Life and Workday through compromised Salesforce systems, with over 1.1 million individuals affected. Critical vulnerabilities in N-able N-central servers remain unpatched despite active exploitation warnings, and threat actors are leveraging Windows vulnerabilities to deploy PipeMagic malware in RansomExx ransomware attacks. Additionally, the ERMAC Android banking trojan source code leak has exposed malware-as-a-service infrastructure, potentially enabling widespread mobile banking attacks.
