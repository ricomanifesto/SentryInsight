# Exploitation Report

Over the last week, threat actors have escalated their activity against widely-used monitoring, collaboration, and gaming platforms as well as open-source supply chains. The most critical events include active ransomware campaigns exploiting an unpatched SimpleHelp RMM flaw, large-scale account-takeover attempts leveraging a newly disclosed Grafana redirect bug (CVE-2024-4981), and privilege-escalation attacks abusing ASUS Armoury Crate on Windows. Simultaneously, the “Water Curse” group and other actors are poisoning GitHub, PyPI, and npm ecosystems, while Discord invite-link hijacking is delivering AsyncRAT and the Skuld stealer. Collectively, these exploits enable SYSTEM-level access, remote code execution, credential theft, and double-extortion ransomware, underscoring the urgency of rapid patching and vigilant supply-chain monitoring.

## Active Exploitation Details

### ASUS Armoury Crate Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: A high-severity flaw in the Armoury Crate service allows locally authenticated users to load arbitrary DLLs, gaining SYSTEM privileges through insecure service loading.
- **Impact**: Full administrative control of Windows endpoints, persistence installation, and lateral-movement staging.
- **Status**: Exploitation observed in the wild; ASUS has released a patched installer via the Armoury Crate updater.

### Grafana Client-Side Open Redirect
- **Description**: A client-side open-redirect vulnerability lets attackers craft URLs that force victims’ browsers to load attacker-controlled plugins, enabling session hijacking and malicious code execution.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized account takeover, data exfiltration, and possible dashboard-level RCE via malicious plugins.
- **Status**: Fixes released by Grafana Labs, yet more than 46,000 Internet-facing instances remain unpatched and are being actively scanned and exploited.
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-4981

### SimpleHelp RMM Critical Flaw
- **Description**: An unauthenticated flaw in SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring & Management allows remote code execution on exposed servers, granting attackers network-wide access.
- **Impact**: Deployment of ransomware payloads, double-extortion data theft, and full takeover of managed infrastructure.
- **Status**: CISA reports active exploitation since January; a vendor update is available but adoption is low.

### Discord Invite-Link Hijacking Weakness
- **Description**: Abuse of Discord’s invite mechanism enables threat actors to hijack or spoof invite links, redirecting users to attacker-controlled servers without obvious warnings.
- **Impact**: Delivery of AsyncRAT and Skuld information stealer, theft of browser-stored credentials and crypto-wallet data.
- **Status**: Ongoing campaign; no platform-level mitigation announced.

### “Water Curse” Weaponized GitHub Repositories
- **Description**: A threat group uploads repositories masquerading as pentesting frameworks that include malicious scripts executing C2 beacons upon cloning or compilation.
- **Impact**: Initial foothold on developers’ or security researchers’ machines, credential harvesting, and supply-chain propagation.
- **Status**: Repositories continuously re-appear despite takedowns; active exploitation confirmed.

### Malicious PyPI / npm Packages Surge
- **Description**: Typosquatting and dependency-confusion packages on PyPI and npm execute obfuscated loaders to pull secondary payloads targeting DevOps and cloud workloads.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution in CI/CD pipelines, cloud credential exfiltration, container breakout.
- **Status**: Packages removed after disclosure, but new variants surface daily.

## Affected Systems and Products

- **ASUS Armoury Crate (Windows 10/11)**: All builds prior to the latest June hotfix  
- **Grafana OSS & Enterprise**: Versions prior to patched releases 9.5.17 / 10.4.3 (client-side redirect)  
- **SimpleHelp RMM**: On-prem instances running versions released before January security update  
- **Discord**: All desktop and web clients susceptible to invite-link hijacking  
- **GitHub Repositories**: Fake pentesting suites (e.g., “SharpStrike-Pro”, “RedTeam-ToolKit”)  
- **PyPI Packages**: “promptai-helper”, “ultra-utils”, “pyautodll” and clones  
- **npm Packages**: “ai-prompt-engine”, “node-miner-kit”, “cloud-deploy-helper”  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **DLL Search-Order Hijacking**: Malformed DLLs loaded by ASUS Armoury Crate service to elevate privileges.  
- **Open Redirect & Plugin Injection**: Crafted Grafana URLs redirect sessions to attacker-controlled plugin endpoints for account takeover.  
- **Unauthenticated RCE via RMM**: Direct web requests to SimpleHelp endpoints execute commands with SYSTEM privileges.  
- **Invite-Link Spoofing**: Replacement or hijack of Discord invites to funnel targets into malware-hosting servers.  
- **Supply-Chain Poisoning**: Typosquatting on PyPI/npm and weaponized GitHub repositories execute malicious post-install scripts.  
- **Double-Extortion Ransomware Deployment**: Ransomware operators leverage SimpleHelp access to deploy encryptors and exfiltrate data.  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Water Curse**  
  - **Campaign**: Weaponized GitHub repos targeting infosec professionals; masquerades as legitimate red-team tools; goal is credential theft and foothold in security environments.  

- **Unnamed Ransomware Groups (CISA Advisory)**  
  - **Campaign**: Systematic exploitation of SimpleHelp RMM servers since January; double-extortion tactics with data theft followed by encryption.  

- **Anubis RaaS Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Added wiper module to ransomware payloads, destroying files beyond recovery; leverages existing footholds from RMM and supply-chain intrusions.  

- **Discord-Based Malware Operators**  
  - **Campaign**: Hijacked invite links deliver AsyncRAT & Skuld stealer; primarily targets crypto-currency enthusiasts and Discord communities.  

- **Foreign State-Linked Actor (Washington Post Email Breach)**  
  - **Campaign**: Compromised journalists’ mailboxes; exact intrusion vector undisclosed but highlights interest in credential harvesting and surveillance.

Security teams should prioritize patching Grafana and SimpleHelp instances, deploy application control to block unsigned DLLs on Windows, enforce strict package-repository policies, and monitor outbound traffic for C2 patterns linked to AsyncRAT, Skuld, and Water Curse infrastructure.
