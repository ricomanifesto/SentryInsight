# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape is currently experiencing significant exploitation activity across multiple vectors, with threat actors leveraging both known vulnerabilities and novel attack techniques. The most critical activity includes the Akira ransomware group's ongoing exploitation of SonicWall SSL VPN devices, successfully bypassing multi-factor authentication protections. Simultaneously, threat actors are deploying sophisticated AI-driven phishing campaigns using LLM-generated obfuscated payloads in SVG files, while fileless attacks impersonating Ukrainian authorities distribute advanced stealer malware. Supply chain attacks continue to plague major organizations, with multiple vehicle manufacturers falling victim to ransomware through compromised suppliers, and the emergence of the first known malicious Model Context Protocol server represents a new frontier in AI-related security threats.

## Active Exploitation Details

### SonicWall SSL VPN Vulnerability
- **Description**: Akira ransomware actors are actively exploiting a vulnerability in SonicWall SSL VPN devices discovered last year, enabling them to breach networks despite multi-factor authentication protections
- **Impact**: Attackers can successfully authenticate to protected VPN accounts and deploy ransomware across enterprise networks
- **Status**: Actively being exploited in ongoing ransomware campaigns targeting SonicWall firewall customers

### AI-Driven SVG Phishing Exploit
- **Description**: Microsoft has identified a phishing campaign utilizing large language models to generate obfuscated SVG file payloads that bypass email security systems
- **Impact**: Enables threat actors to deliver malware while evading traditional email security detection mechanisms
- **Status**: Active campaign primarily targeting U.S.-based organizations

### Fileless Phishing Campaign
- **Description**: Attackers impersonating Ukrainian National Police are deploying fileless attacks using malicious Scalable Vector Graphics to deliver Amatera Stealer and PureMiner malware
- **Impact**: Credential theft and cryptocurrency mining on compromised systems
- **Status**: Currently active, targeting Ukrainian organizations and individuals
