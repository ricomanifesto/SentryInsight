# Exploitation Report

Critical vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild, with the most significant threats targeting enterprise infrastructure and widely-used software applications. The Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centre has confirmed active exploitation of a critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2025-6543) that has successfully breached critical organizations. Additionally, researchers have documented zero-day attacks exploiting a WinRAR path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-8088) by the Russian RomCom hacking group to distribute malware. These incidents highlight the ongoing threat landscape where both newly discovered vulnerabilities and established attack vectors continue to pose significant risks to organizations worldwide.
