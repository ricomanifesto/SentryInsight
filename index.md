# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity landscape reveals critical active exploitation across multiple platforms and services. The most significant threats include zero-day exploitation by established ransomware groups, with Clop ransomware gang actively exploiting a critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day since early August for data theft operations. Concurrent WordPress theme vulnerabilities are being exploited for authentication bypass, while Chinese threat actors weaponize legitimate open-source tools for remote access trojan deployment. The Figma MCP server vulnerability (CVE-2025-53967) presents immediate remote code execution risks requiring urgent patching. Additionally, Medusa ransomware operators are exploiting Fortra GoAnywhere vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-10035), and sophisticated phishing campaigns target cloud environments and social media professionals.
