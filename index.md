# Exploitation Report

A surge of high-impact remote-code-execution (RCE) exploits is driving emergency patching across enterprise, cloud, automotive, and AI environments. Attackers are actively leveraging critical flaws in Wing FTP Server, Fortinet FortiWeb appliances, and Citrix NetScaler gateways, while proof-of-concept (PoC) code and real-world breaches show opportunistic exploitation of Laravel misconfigurations, OpenSynergy’s Bluetooth stack, and a hard-coded password weakness in McDonald’s McHire platform. Concurrently, novel hardware-level techniques such as “GPUHammer” RowHammer attacks threaten NVIDIA GPUs used in AI workloads, and supply-chain compromises—from WordPress Gravity Forms installers to the OpenVSX extension marketplace—demonstrate expanding adversary focus on developer and CI/CD tooling. Iranian-linked Pay2Key ransomware operators and other financially motivated groups are capitalizing on these weaknesses, underscoring the critical need for rapid patching and layered defenses.

- **Status**: Field-exploitable; vendor patches in progress, mitigation guidance issued.

### McHire Hard-Coded Password Exposure
- **Description**: Use of the weak password “123456” in McDonald’s chatbot backend exposed chat logs for 64 million job applicants.
- **Impact**: Disclosure of PII, potential spear-phishing and identity fraud.
- **Status**: Vulnerability fixed after researcher report; historical data already exposed.

### OpenVSX Extension Marketplace Zero-Day
- **Description**: Flaw in OpenVSX namespace validation let attackers publish malicious extensions that would be auto-updated for Cursor and Windsurf IDE users.
- **Impact**: Supply-chain RCE on millions of developer machines, credential and source-code theft.
- **Status**: Patched; retroactive audits recommended.

### Gravity Forms Supply-Chain Backdoor
- **Description**: Compromise of Gravity Forms developer infrastructure injected PHP backdoors into manual installer ZIPs.
- **Impact**: WordPress site compromise, web-shell deployment, site defacement, and data exfiltration.
- **Status**: Infected packages replaced; users must verify hashes and reinstall clean versions.

### eSIM Oracle-Derived Vulnerability
- **Description**: Legacy Oracle bug in eSIM provisioning stack enables SIM profile cloning and remote spying/takeover of mobile devices.
- **Impact**: Voice/SMS interception, device impersonation, persistent surveillance.
- **Status**: No universal patch; carriers evaluating mitigation strategies.

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **RowHammer/GPUHammer**: Repeated memory row activation to induce bit flips in GDDR6, corrupting models.  
- **SQL Injection to RCE**: FortiWeb flaw abuses crafted HTTP parameter to execute DB commands and spawn shells.  
- **Memory-Leak Session Hijacking**: Citrix Bleed 2 exfiltrates session tokens directly from appliance memory.  
- **Deserialization RCE**: Laravel APP_KEY misuse signs malicious payloads that the framework unserializes.  
- **Bluetooth 1-Click RCE**: PerfektBlue delivers malicious SDP packets to BlueSDK, triggering heap corruption.  
- **Hard-coded Password Access**: Static credential “123456” allows unauthenticated API queries to McHire backend.  
- **Malicious Extension Supply-Chain**: OpenVSX namespace spoofing auto-pushes backdoored VSCode extensions.  
- **Backdoored Installer Delivery**: Gravity Forms compromised build pipeline inserts PHP shells into ZIP downloads.
