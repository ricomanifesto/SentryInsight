# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity threats demonstrate a concerning landscape of active exploitation across multiple platforms and sectors. Critical vulnerabilities are being leveraged by sophisticated threat actors, including Chinese APT groups exploiting VMware infrastructure for nearly a year, the emergence of advanced Android banking trojans like Klopatra that have compromised over 3,000 devices, and ongoing ransomware campaigns targeting enterprise systems. Notable activities include the Clop ransomware group's extortion campaign against Oracle E-Business Suite users, ShinyHunters' social engineering tactics against Salesforce environments, and the deployment of CABINETRAT backdoors in targeted attacks against Ukraine. Hardware-level attacks are also emerging, with researchers demonstrating new techniques to extract cryptographic keys from Intel SGX through memory bus interception.
