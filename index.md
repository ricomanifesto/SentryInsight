# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day exploitation activity is currently targeting Citrix NetScaler infrastructure, with CVE-2025-7775 being actively exploited in the wild as a remote code execution vulnerability. This represents a significant threat to enterprise networks relying on NetScaler ADC and Gateway technologies. Additionally, threat actors are conducting sophisticated supply chain attacks through OAuth token theft, targeting sales automation platforms to pivot into customer environments. State-sponsored groups are also leveraging network infrastructure hijacking techniques to target diplomatic entities, while coordinated scanning campaigns against Remote Desktop Services suggest potential preparation for future exploitation activities.
