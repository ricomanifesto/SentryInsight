# Exploitation Report

The cybersecurity landscape faces significant threats from multiple active exploitation campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and enterprise systems. Nation-state actors have successfully breached F5's BIG-IP environment, stealing undisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities and source code. CISA has flagged an Adobe Experience Manager vulnerability with a perfect 10.0 CVSS score that is already under active attack. Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 183 security flaws, including three zero-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild. Additional critical threats include exploitation of Oracle systems affecting Harvard University, ICTBroadcast server compromises, and sophisticated attacks targeting Red Lion industrial control systems.
