# Exploitation Report

Multiple critical vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in the wild, with several high-impact campaigns targeting enterprise systems. Most concerning are the ongoing attacks against SonicWall SMA devices by the UNC6148 threat group using the OVERSTEP backdoor, state-sponsored exploitation of Libraesva Email Security Gateway systems, and the discovery of active exploitation of Pandoc CVE-2025-51591 to target AWS cloud infrastructure. Additionally, suspected Chinese threat actors continue leveraging the BRICKSTORM backdoor for long-term persistence in espionage operations against U.S. organizations, while CISA has confirmed that federal agencies were compromised through unpatched GeoServer instances.
