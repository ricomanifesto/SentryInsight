# Exploitation Report

Critical zero-day exploitation activity has been observed across multiple high-profile targets, with Chinese threat actors leading sophisticated campaigns. The most severe ongoing threat involves zero-day exploitation of VMware systems since October 2024, affecting virtualization infrastructure globally. Additionally, CISA has issued urgent warnings about active exploitation of a critical Linux Sudo vulnerability that enables root-level privilege escalation. Concurrent attacks include the deployment of advanced backdoors like CABINETRAT in Ukraine, exploitation of nearly 50,000 Cisco firewall appliances, and the emergence of sophisticated banking trojans targeting elderly victims through AI-generated social engineering campaigns.

## Active Exploitation Details

### VMware Zero-Day Vulnerability
