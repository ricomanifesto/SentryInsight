# Exploitation Report

Current threat activity reveals several critical security incidents requiring immediate attention. WhatsApp has addressed a zero-day vulnerability in its iOS and macOS messaging clients that was actively exploited in targeted attacks, representing a significant threat to mobile and desktop users. Additionally, threat actors are leveraging legitimate forensic tools like Velociraptor to deploy Visual Studio Code for command and control tunneling, demonstrating sophisticated abuse of trusted security software. The TamperedChef infostealer campaign continues to target users through fraudulent PDF editing applications distributed via Google ads, while researchers have identified new exploit chains in Sitecore Experience Platform that could lead to remote code execution.

## Active Exploitation Details
