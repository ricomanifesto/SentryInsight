# Exploitation Report

Recent intelligence highlights two separate, fully operational exploit campaigns. A North American state-aligned threat group is weaponizing an undisclosed Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day to gain clandestine access to Chinese targets, while the Initial Access Broker **Gold Melody** is monetizing compromised ASP.NET environments by abusing leaked **machineKey** values to forge authentication cookies and hijack sessions. Both avenues provide immediate, high-impact access to email or web infrastructure and are being leveraged for espionage, lateral movement, and credential harvesting. Rapid defensive action is required.

## Active Exploitation Details

### Microsoft Exchange Server Zero-Day
- **Description**: A previously unknown flaw in on-premises Microsoft Exchange allows remote adversaries to execute arbitrary code on the underlying Windows host. Researchers observed the bug being chained with post-exploitation tooling to implant web shells and exfiltrate mailbox data.  
- **Impact**: Full takeover of Exchange, persistent access to corporate email, privilege escalation within the Windows domain, and potential lateral movement across the network.  
- **Status**: Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation by a North American APT; Microsoft has not yet released a patch. Temporary mitigations (URL Rewrite, IIS rule hardening, and disabling unneeded Exchange services) are advised.  

### ASP.NET Machine Key Exposure Exploit
- **Description**: When the `machineKey` element used for ASP.NET view-state validation and forms authentication is leaked (e.g., via source-code repositories or misconfigured backups), attackers can craft valid authentication cookies and signed payloads. Gold Melody harvests these keys to impersonate legitimate users and plant further malware.  
- **Impact**: Immediate unauthorized access to web applications, privilege escalation to administrator roles, deployment of loaders or ransomware, and subsequent sale of access on dark-web marketplaces.  
- **Status**: Actively exploited by Gold Melody IAB in an ongoing campaign. No vendor patch is possible because the weakness stems from poor key management; remediation requires key rotation and secure storage practices.  

## Affected Systems and Products

- **Microsoft Exchange Server (2013, 2016, 2019)**  
  - **Platform**: Self-hosted Windows Server deployments in government, telecom, and manufacturing sectors  

- **ASP.NET-based Web Applications running on IIS**  
  - **Platform**: Windows Server environments where `machineKey` values have been exposed via configuration leaks or public repositories  

## Attack Vectors and Techniques

- **Server-Side Remote Code Execution via Zero-Day**  
  - **Vector**: Crafted HTTP requests exploiting the undisclosed Exchange vulnerability, followed by web-shell installation (`/owa/auth/`) and PowerShell remoting  

- **Authentication Cookie Forgery (Machine Key Abuse)**  
  - **Vector**: Use of stolen `machineKey` to generate valid `.ASPXAUTH` cookies and malicious ViewState data, bypassing login screens and application-level ACLs  

- **Web Shell Deployment & Command Execution**  
  - **Vector**: Once inside Exchange, adversaries drop China-Chopper-style shells for persistent command execution over HTTPS  

- **Credential Dumping & Mailbox Exfiltration**  
  - **Vector**: Post-exploitation use of Exchange Management Shell and `Export-Mailbox` cmdlets to siphon sensitive communications  

## Threat Actor Activities

- **Actor/Group**: Unnamed North American APT  
  - **Campaign**: Targeted compromise of Chinese government and industrial networks using the Exchange zero-day for strategic intelligence gathering and potential sabotage  

- **Actor/Group**: Gold Melody Initial Access Broker  
  - **Campaign**: Global sale of footholds in organizations that inadvertently leaked ASP.NET machine keys; observed pivoting to ransomware affiliates and data-theft crews for monetization  

These exploits present immediate business-critical risk. Organizations running on-premises Exchange or ASP.NET applications should prioritize threat hunting for suspicious HTTP requests, unexpected web-shell artifacts, and anomalous authentication cookie activity, while expediting contingency plans for patching or key rotation.
