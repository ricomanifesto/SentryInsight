# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently underway across multiple enterprise platforms, with several maximum-severity vulnerabilities being actively exploited by threat actors. The most significant threats include a 13-year-old Redis vulnerability with a CVSS 10.0 score enabling remote code execution, Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day attacks by the Cl0p ransomware group, and GoAnywhere MFT exploitation facilitating Medusa ransomware deployment. Additional zero-day activity has been observed against Zimbra Collaboration Suite through malicious calendar files targeting Brazilian military systems, while Unity game engine vulnerabilities expose millions of gamers to potential attacks.

## Active Exploitation Details
