## Exploited Vulnerabilities

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

1. **VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint Zero-Days**
   - **Description**: During Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, zero-day vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint were exploited.
   - **Impact**: These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise.
   - **Affected Systems**: VMware ESXi, Microsoft SharePoint.
   - **Mitigation**: Organizations should apply patches released by VMware and Microsoft as soon as they are available.

2. **Chat App Zero-Day Exploited by Turkish APT**
   - **Description**: A zero-day vulnerability in a chat application was exploited by the threat actor group known as Marbled Dust or Sea Turtle.
   - **Impact**: Allowed attackers to spy on military targets, specifically targeting Iraqi Kurds.
   - **Affected Systems**: Specific chat application used by targeted groups.
   - **Mitigation**: Users should apply patches and updates as soon as they are released and consider using alternative secure communication platforms.

### Recently Patched Vulnerabilities

1. **Chrome Zero-Day (CVE-2025-XXXX)**
   - **Description**: A high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser was actively exploited in the wild.
   - **Impact**: Could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or bypass security restrictions.
   - **Affected Systems**: Google Chrome on all platforms.
   - **Mitigation**: Update Chrome to the latest version immediately.

### New Attack Vectors and Techniques

1. **Defendnot Tool**
   - **Description**: A tool that tricks Windows into disabling Microsoft Defender by registering a fake antivirus product.
   - **Impact**: Leaves systems vulnerable to malware and other threats.
   - **Affected Systems**: Windows devices.
   - **Mitigation**: Ensure that Microsoft Defender is correctly configured and regularly check for unauthorized changes to security settings.

2. **Dynamic DNS as a Cyberattack Facilitator**
   - **Description**: Threat actors are using dynamic DNS services to obfuscate their activities and impersonate well-known brands.
   - **Impact**: Facilitates phishing and other malicious activities.
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor DNS traffic for suspicious activity and use DNS filtering solutions.

3. **Fileless Remcos RAT via LNK Files and MSHTA**
   - **Description**: A new malware campaign uses PowerShell-based shellcode loaders to deploy Remcos RAT.
   - **Impact**: Allows attackers to gain remote access and control over infected systems.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strict email filtering and endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malicious scripts.

### Notable Threat Actors

1. **Scattered Spider**
   - **Activity**: Using dynamic DNS to facilitate phishing attacks.
   - **Target**: Various sectors, including technology and finance.

2. **Marbled Dust/Sea Turtle**
   - **Activity**: Exploiting chat app zero-day to spy on military targets.
   - **Target**: Iraqi Kurds.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly update all software and systems to the latest versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.
2. **Security Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.
3. **User Education**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate users about phishing and other social engineering attacks.
4. **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions to detect and block malware and unauthorized access attempts.
5. **Network Security**: Use firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and DNS filtering to protect network infrastructure.

By following these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of exploitation and improve their overall security posture.
