# Exploitation Report

Multiple significant exploitation campaigns are currently active, with threat actors leveraging SonicWall SSL VPN vulnerabilities, browser extension malware, and sophisticated APT operations. The Akira ransomware group continues to exploit SonicWall devices for initial access, while malicious browser extensions are hijacking Meta business accounts. Chinese APT groups are deploying advanced fileless malware against military targets and conducting spear-phishing campaigns impersonating US officials. Additionally, a massive NPM supply-chain attack has impacted approximately 10% of cloud environments, though attackers reportedly made minimal profit from the compromise.
