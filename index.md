# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals significant malware distribution campaigns targeting Android devices and sophisticated state-sponsored operations. Android dropper applications have evolved beyond traditional banking trojans to deliver SMS stealers and spyware, while the North Korean APT group ScarCruft continues targeted phishing campaigns against South Korean academics using RokRAT malware. Additionally, Russian state-sponsored group APT29 (Midnight Blizzard) has been actively targeting Microsoft 365 accounts, though their operations have been disrupted by Amazon's security team. The Brokewell Android malware is being distributed through fraudulent TradingView advertisements on Meta's platforms, and a data breach at Zscaler has exposed customer information following a compromise of their Salesforce instance.
