# Exploitation Report

The current threat landscape reveals a surge of critical vulnerabilities being actively exploited across multiple sectors, with particular focus on industrial control systems, enterprise software, and mobile platforms. Microsoft's October 2025 Patch Tuesday addresses 172 security flaws including six zero-day vulnerabilities already under active exploitation. Critical industrial systems face severe risks with two maximum-severity vulnerabilities in Red Lion RTUs that could grant complete industrial control to attackers. Meanwhile, threat actors are leveraging novel attack vectors including cookie-based exploits against ICTBroadcast servers, geo-mapping server compromises for persistent backdoor access, and sophisticated side-channel attacks targeting Android devices to steal multi-factor authentication codes.
