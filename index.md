# Exploitation Report

Current cybersecurity intelligence reveals significant threat actor activity across multiple fronts, with notable developments in phishing infrastructure takedowns, cybercrime forum operations, and sophisticated social engineering campaigns. The Scattered Spider cybercrime group has resurfaced with renewed attacks on financial institutions despite previous claims of retirement, while law enforcement continues to target major cybercrime infrastructure. New malware variants are emerging with self-replicating capabilities targeting software supply chains, and state-sponsored actors are leveraging advanced deepfake technology for military intelligence operations.

## Active Exploitation Details

### RaccoonO365 Phishing-as-a-Service
- **Description**: A financially motivated phishing network operating a comprehensive phishing-as-a-service platform targeting organizations globally
- **Impact**: Large-scale credential harvesting and unauthorized access to corporate accounts through sophisticated phishing campaigns
