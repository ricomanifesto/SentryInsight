# Exploitation Report

Critical exploitation activity is currently being observed across multiple attack vectors, with Russian threat actors actively exploiting patched Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities to deploy stealer malware, while new ransomware groups are demonstrating advanced EDR bypass capabilities. Cisco has issued urgent patches for a maximum severity remote code execution vulnerability in their Firewall Management Center, and telecommunications infrastructure is under active attack by both ransomware groups and state-sponsored actors. The threat landscape shows sophisticated attackers leveraging customized open-source tools and targeting high-value sectors including financial services and critical infrastructure.
