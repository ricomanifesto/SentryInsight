# Exploitation Report

Based on the analyzed security articles, there are several critical vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild. The most significant threats include a critical FortiSIEM vulnerability with active exploit code, a publicly disclosed Kerberos zero-day vulnerability patched by Microsoft, and critical security flaws in Zoom and Xerox products that could enable privilege escalation and remote code execution. Additionally, a new ransomware campaign called Charon is targeting Middle East sectors using advanced evasion tactics.

## Active Exploitation Details

### FortiSIEM Critical Vulnerability
- **Description**: A critical security flaw in Fortinet's FortiSIEM platform that poses significant risk to organizations
- **Impact**: Attackers can potentially compromise security information and event management systems, gaining access to critical security monitoring infrastructure
- **Status**: Exploit code exists in the wild; Fortinet has issued security alerts to customers
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-25256

### Microsoft Kerberos Zero-Day Vulnerability
- **Description**: A zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft's Kerberos authentication protocol that was publicly disclosed before patches were available
- **Impact**: Could allow attackers to compromise authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to systems
- **Status**: Patched in Microsoft's August 2025 Patch Tuesday release; was publicly known at time of patch release
- **Status**: Fixed as part of 111 total security flaws addressed in the August update

### Zoom Client Privilege Escalation Flaw
- **Description**: Critical security vulnerability in Zoom Clients for Windows that could allow privilege escalation
- **Impact**: Attackers could gain elevated privileges on compromised Windows systems running Zoom
- **Status**: Critical security updates released by Zoom

### Xerox FreeFlow Core Remote Code Execution
- **Description**: Critical vulnerability in Xerox FreeFlow Core that enables remote code execution
- **Impact**: Attackers could execute arbitrary code remotely on affected Xerox systems
- **Status**: Critical security updates released by Xerox
