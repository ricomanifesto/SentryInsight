- **China-Linked APTs**: Exploiting SAP vulnerabilities to target critical infrastructure.
- **Konni (Opal Sleet, TA406)**: North Korean group targeting Ukrainian government entities.

## Recommendations for Mitigation

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly apply security patches from vendors, especially for critical and zero-day vulnerabilities.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical systems to limit the impact of potential breaches.
3. **Security Training**: Conduct regular training for employees to recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics.
4. **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy advanced endpoint protection solutions to detect and respond to threats.
5. **Vulnerability Management**: Continuously monitor and assess systems for vulnerabilities and apply mitigations promptly.

By following these recommendations and staying informed about the latest threats, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of exploitation and enhance their overall security posture.
